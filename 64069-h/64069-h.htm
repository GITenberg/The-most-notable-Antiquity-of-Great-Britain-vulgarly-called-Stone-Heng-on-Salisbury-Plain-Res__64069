    a rude Form, from some few indigested notes of the late judicious
    <i>Architect</i>, the <i>Vitruvius</i> of his age <i>Inigo Jones</i>.
    That so venerable an <i>Antiquity</i> might not perish, but the world
    made beholding to him for restoring it to light, the desires of
    severall his learned <i>Friends</i> have encouraged me to compose this
    Treatise. Had he survived to have done it with his own hand, there had
    needed no Apology. Such as it is, I make now yours. Accept it in <i>his

  <p class="drop-cap">BEing naturally inclined in my younger years to study the <i>Arts of
    Designe</i>, I passed into forrain parts to converse with the great
    Masters thereof in <i>Italy</i>; where I applied my self to search
    out the ruines of those ancient <i>Buildings</i>, which in despight
    of <i>Time</i> it self, and violence of <i>Barbarians</i> are yet
    remaining. Having satisfied my self in these, and returning to my
    native <i>Countrey</i>, I applied my minde more particularly to the
    study of <i>Architecture</i>. Among the ancient monuments whereof,
    found here, I deemed none more worthy the searching after, then this of
    <i>Stoneheng</i>; not only in regard of the <i>Founders</i> thereof,
    the <i>Time</i> when built, the <i>Work</i> it self, but also for the
    rarity of its <i>Invention</i>, being different in <i>Forme</i> from
    all I had seen before: likewise, of as beautifull <i>Proportions</i>,
    as elegant in <i>Order</i>, and as stately in <i>Aspect</i>, as any.</p>

  <p>King <i>James</i>, in his progresse, the year one thousand six
    hundred and twenty, being at <i>Wilton</i>, and discoursing of this
    <i>Antiquity</i>, I was sent for by the right Honourable <i>William</i>
    then <i>Earl of Pembrook</i>, and received there his Majesties
    commands to produce out of mine own practise in <i>Architecture</i>,
    and experience in <i>Antiquities</i> abroad, what possibly I could
    discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> concerning this of <i>Stoneheng</i>. What mine opinion was
    then, and what I have since collected in relation thereunto; I intend
    to make the subject of this present Treatise. And certainly, in the
    intricate, and obscure study of <i>Antiquity</i> it is far easier (as
    <i>Camden</i> very well observes) to refute and contradict a false,
    then to set down a true and certain resolution. For mine own part,
    in what I shall here deliver, I intend not to struggle against any
    opinion commonly, and long since received. Let every man judge as it
    pleaseth him. What opinion soever the Reader inclines to, I shall not
    make much materiall, my aime being, a desire only to vindicate, as much
    as in me lies, the <i>Founders</i> of this venerable <i>Antiquity</i>
    from oblivion, and to make the truth, as far forth as possibly I may,
    appeare to all men.</p>

  <p>Severall Writers, both Strangers, and our own Countreymen, have treated
    of <i>Stoneheng</i>. Before recite whole opinions, I think not amisse
    to seek this subject from the most ancient times, endevouring thereby
    to give satisfaction whether or no, the <i>Druides</i>, <i>aliàs</i>
    <i>Druidæ</i> (in Authors indifferently written, and in old time
    the <i>Priests</i> of the <i>Britans</i> and <i>Gauls</i>) or the
    ancient <i>Britans</i>, for the <i>Druid’s</i> use, might not be the
    <i>Founders</i> of so notable a monument; which if they were, there is
    then no cause why bestow farther study or pains, in searching who the
    <i>Founders</i> were, but acquiesce in the honour of our own Nations
    first erection of it.</p>

  <p>As far neverthelesse, as from History ancient or moderne may be
    gathered, there is little likelyhood of any such matter, considering
    especially what the <i>Druid’s</i> were; also, what small experience
    the <i>Britans</i>, anciently inhabiting this Isle, had, in knowledge
    of what ever <i>Arts</i>, much lesse of building, with like elegancy
    and proportion, such goodly works as <i>Stoneheng</i>.</p>

  <p>Concerning the <i>Druid’s</i> in the first place, true it is, they
    are reported in ancient times, to have been in great esteeme in this
    Island, where their discipline, and manner of learning, was supposed
    to be first invented, and from hence translated into <i>Gaul</i>.
    <i>Disciplina in Britannia reperta</i> (saith <i>Cæsar</i>)
    <span class="sni"><i>Cæsar. Commen. lib. 6.</i></span>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> <i>atque
    inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur.</i> They are said in
    like manner no have ordered and disposed all divine matters, as well
    in relation to their severall kinds of Sacrifices, as to expounding
    whatever rites of their idolatrous superstition;<span class="sni"><i>Plin. lib. 16.</i></span>
    insomuch, you may call them (if you please) the Bishops and Clergy of that Age.</p>

  <p>Their power moreover, and preheminence was not confined within the
    strict limits of sacred matters, but enjoying a more large prerogative,
    temporall negotiations, and affairs of State were transacted by them:
    the managing of Peace and War was usually remitted to their Authority,
    even when Armies were ready to joyn in Battell. <i>Publica iis</i>
    (saith <i>Strabo</i><span class="sni"><i>Strab. lib. 4.</i></span>) <i>&amp; privata judicia committuntur, &amp; aliquando
    causis bellorum disceptandis jam acie congressuros composuerunt.</i>
    Judges they were (saith <i>Cæsar</i><span class="sni"><i>Cæsar. lib. 6.</i></span> also) in almost all civill and
    criminall causes: sentence they gave in case of life and death: decide
    they did controversies, and debates betwixt party and party: finally,
    whatever else was requisite and convenient to keep the people in due
    obedience to their <i>Princes</i>, they wholly took the care and charge
    of.</p>

  <p>These were the maine affaires wherein the employment of the
    <i>Druides</i> consisted, and whereunto they wholly addicted
    themselves. Whosoever desires to know more of them, may read
    <i>Cæsar</i>, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, <i>Strabo</i>, <i>Pliny</i>,
    <i>Diogenes Laertius</i>, <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i>, and such like
    ancient Authors. But, whatsoever these, or other Historians have
    written of the <i>Druides</i>, certainly, <i>Stoneheng</i> could
    not be builded by them, in regard, I find no mention, they were at
    any time either studious in <i>Architecture</i>, (which in this
    subject is chiefly to be respected) or skilfull in any thing else
    conducing thereunto. For, <i>Academies</i> of <i>Designe</i> were
    unknown unto them: publique Lectures in the <i>Mathematiques</i> not
    read amongst them: nothing of their <i>Painting</i>, not one word
    of their <i>Sculpture</i> is to be found, or scarce of any Science
    (<i>Philosophy</i> and <i>Astronomy</i> excepted) proper to informe
    the judgement of an <i>Architect</i>; who, (as <i>Vitruvius</i> <span class="sni"><i>Vitr. li. 1.</i></span> saith)
    should be <i>peritus Graphidos, eruditus Geometria, &amp; Optices non<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    ignarus</i> &amp;c. <i>perfect in Designe, expert in Geometry, well seen
    in the Opticks, skilfull in Arithmetick, a good Historian, a diligent
    hearer of Philosophers, well experienced in Physick, Musick, Law and
    Astrologie</i>.</p>

  <p>Of all that have written of the <i>Druid’s</i>, no Author knew them
    better then <i>Cæsar</i>, neither hath any more fully described them;
    who after a large discourse of their discipline, priviledges, and
    <i>Theologie,<span class="sni"><i>Cæsar. li. 6.</i></span> Multa de sideribus</i> (saith he) <i>atque eorum motu,
    de mundi ac terrarum magnitudine, de rerum natura, &amp;c. disputant,
    &amp; juventuti transdunt. They make much dispute, and instruct their
    Scholars in many things concerning the Stars, and their motion, the
    greatnesse of Heaven and Earth, of the nature of things &amp;c.</i> As
    for other Arts relating to the <i>Mathematiques</i>, or any works
    of this kind, he makes no manner of mention, though himself an
    <i>Architect</i>, glorying in his own, and much more extolling others
    invention in that <i>Art</i>.</p>

  <p>The truth is, those ancient times had no knowledge of publique works,
    either Sacred or Secular, for their own use, or honour of their
    <i>Deities</i>. Besides, they us’d not any buildings of Stone, or (for
    ought is manifest) knew so much, as how to order working therein.
    The <i>Druid’s</i> led a solitary contemplative life, contenting
    themselves with such habitations, as either meer necessity invented, to
    shelter them from contrariety of seasons, without <i>Art</i>, without
    <i>Order</i>, without any whatever means tending to perpetuity: or,
    such as <i>Nature</i> alone had prepared for them in dens, and caves
    of desert and darksome woods; esteeming it, questionlesse, the highest
    secret of their mystery, rather to command in caves and cottages, then
    live like Kings, in Palaces, and stately houses. They were too wise,
    knew too well, ’twas their humility, integrity, retired manner of life,
    and pretended sanctity possest the people with an awfully reverend
    esteem of them; and which fed, and kept up their reputation throughout
    the Countrey, when outward appearances of State and magnificence
    would either have brought them into envy, and their superstition
    into contempt, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> themselves and <i>Religion</i> both to be wholly
    extirpated and laid aside.</p>

  <p><i>Pomponius Mela</i><span class="sni"><i>Pomp. Mela lib. 3.</i></span> discoursing of the <i>Druides</i>, <i>Docent
    multa</i> (saith he) <i>nobilissimos gentis clam &amp; diu vicenis annis
    in specu, aut in abditis saltibus</i>, <i>They teach the Nobility, and
    better sort of their nation, many things, even twenty years together,
    secretly in caves, or close coverts of obscure woods and forrests</i>.
    Such, and no other were their habitations, such their Universities, and
    publique Schooles.</p>

  <p>As for their <i>Temples</i> and sacred structures, they consisted
    not in variety of formes, costlinesse of materials, or perfection of
    humane <i>Arts</i>, but were of <i>Natures</i> own framing in like
    manner, being no other then groves of Oke. <i>The</i> Druid’s <i>chose
    of purpose</i> (saith <i>Pliny</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Pliny lib. 16.</i></span> <i>such groves for their divine
    Service, as stood only upon Okes; nay they solemnized no Sacrifice,
    nor performed any sacred Ceremonies without the branches, and leaves
    thereof; from whence they may seem well enough to be named</i> Dryadæ
    <i>in</i> Greek, <i>which signifies as much as</i> Oke Priests.</p>

  <p>The <i>Romans</i> having forced their passage, and gained victory
    over the <i>Druid’s</i> in <i>Anglesey</i>, cut down their woods and
    groves, amongst them reckoned holy, and consecrated to their execrable
    superstitions. <i>Excisi luci</i> (saith <i>Tacitus</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</i></span> <i>sævis
    superstitionibus sacri</i>.</p>

  <p>To this purpose, <i>Humphrey Lloid</i>, in his history of <i>Wales</i>,
    The vast woods growing in that Island, were not only by the
    <i>Romans</i>, but afterwards, when the <i>Christian</i> Faith took
    place in this <i>Nation</i>, by the <i>Christians</i> also fell’d and
    rooted out. And why? because of the idolatry (saith he) and absurd
    Religion used in them. Again, in his Epistle to <i>Ortelius</i>
    concerning the Isle of <i>Anglesey</i>, the same Author affirmes;
    Though there is little wood now growing there, yet every day the roots
    and bodies of huge trees of a wonderfull length and bignesse are by the
    inhabitants found, and digged out of the earth, in divers places in low
    grounds, and champion fields.</p>

  <p>Now, if in stead of these roots, and bodies of trees, the ruines of
    ancient Structures had been there found, it might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> peradventure, with
    some probability, have been presumed either that the <i>Druid’s</i>
    used <i>Temples</i>, or some other buildings of stone. For, their
    ancient seat was in the Isle of <i>Mona</i>, now <i>Anglesey</i>,
    whence modern Writers style it <i>Insulam Druidum</i>, the
    <i>Island</i> of the <i>Druid’s</i>, and <i>sedem Druidum</i>, the
    seat of the <i>Druid’s</i>. And from hence, questionlesse, it came to
    passe, the <i>Romans</i>, with such difficulty, under the conduct of
    <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i>, brought that Island under their power; nor
    was it wholly subdued to their Empire, untill <i>Julius Agricola’s</i>
    time. For, whereas in other parts of <i>Britain</i>, the people
    contended for Liberty only, there, they fought <i>pro aris &amp; focis</i>,
    for Liberty, and Religion both.</p>

  <p>There it was the <i>British</i> armies (saith <i>Tacitus</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. Ann. lib. 16.</i></span> being
    imbattailed, the women ran to and fro amongst them in sable weeds,
    their hair about their ears, and fire-brands in their hands, like
    infernall furies, the <i>Druid’s</i> round about them also, lifting up
    their hands to Heaven, and pouring forth deadly curses; the novelty
    of which sight bred such amazement in the <i>Roman Legions</i>, (the
    <i>Romans</i> here, it seems, were unacquainted with the <i>Druid’s</i>
    till then) that they stood stock still, and close together, not once
    moving a foot, as if possessed with a resolution to act nothing at all,
    but receive their deaths tamely and without any great resistance.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, besides, that History hath not remembred the ruines of
    any ancient buildings digged up in <i>Anglesey</i>; if either, this
    <i>Antiquity</i> had been remaining in that <i>Island</i>, or any
    Author delivered such Actions of the <i>Druid’s</i>, as aforesaid,
    performed about the place, where <i>Stoneheng</i> remains standing,
    there might have been some advantage made thereof to the purpose now in
    hand. But <i>Anglesey</i> excepted, ancient Writers give them residence
    in no part of <i>Britain</i> beside, nor are they remembred by any, to
    have been found elswhere, throughout the whole Nation. With respect
    whereunto, if the <i>Druid’s</i> had knowledge, either to build the
    like magnificent structures, or use, for any such, they would, without
    all peradventure, have erected them upon the same place rather where
    themselves resided, then elswhere.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

  <p>Neither are we to wonder, they chose such an out-nook or corner as
    <i>Anglesey</i>, to reside in; in regard, there, they lived remote,
    and solitary; there, were store of caves, and dens to instruct their
    Scholars in, close and retired places for their own habitations, and
    plenty of groves to perform their sacred mysteries in. Moreover, they
    past their days there, like the Hermits of old time, according to
    their own desire, in full contentment, and with free liberty to study,
    and contemplate what they pleased. For, <i>Anglesey</i> (we must
    know) in those times of yore, was wholly overgrown with desert Woods,
    and obscure forrests, from whence the ancient <i>Britans</i> call’d
    it <i>Ynis Dowil</i>, the shadowy or dark <i>Island</i>. Which name
    it still retains, and is well known thereby to the now inhabitants,
    who are, even at this day, likewise enclined, (yea, they usually
    accustome themselves) to commit things more to Memory, then Writing;
    and, as having received it by tradition from their Ancestors, living
    in those ancient times, still endevour to observe that custom of the
    <i>Druid’s, who held it unlawfull to commit any thing to writing</i>.
    As <i>Cæsar</i><span class="sni"><i>Cæs. Com. lib. 6.</i></span> (in the sixth book of his Commentaries of the Gaulish
    war) delivers.</p>

  <p>Concerning the <i>Britans</i> in the next place, The condition of those
    ancient inhabitants of this Island in the <i>Druid’s</i> time duly
    considered, (<i>viz.</i> in what manner they lived, how unskilfull in
    all Sciences, and civill customs, what Deities they had, in what places
    they adored them, and what manner of buildings, or sacred or secular,
    were used by them) as little reason appears, that this Antiquity was by
    them erected.</p>

  <p>As for their manner of living, the <i>Britans</i> were then a savage
    and barbarous people, knowing no use at all of garments. <i>Vestis
    usum non cognoscunt</i> (saith <i>Herodian</i>.)<span class="sni"><i>Herodian. lib. 3.</i></span> Now, if destitute of
    the knowledge, even to clothe themselves, much lesse any knowledge
    had they to erect stately structures, or such remarkable works as
    <i>Stoneheng</i>. What fashions they used to adorn their bodies with,
    the same Author tells us. <i>As a rare and rich habiliment, they wore
    about their wasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> and necks ornaments of iron</i> (saith he) <i>and
    did pounce and colour their bodies with sundry forms, in rude manner
    representing severall creatures</i>. In which regard, they would not be
    otherwise clothed, lest constrain’d thereby to hide such their simple
    (though with them much esteemed) bravery.
  </p>

  <p>Again, in other their civill customs, they were no lesse rude and
    ignorant; yea, so barbarous, even in things appertaining to common
    sustenance, and whatever husbandry; that (as <i>Strabo</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Strabo li. 4.</i></span> <i>Quidam
    eorum ob imperitiam caseos nullos conficiant, cum tamen lacte abundent:
    alii hortos colendi, &amp; aliarum partium agriculturæ ignari sunt</i>.
    <i>Many of them, though they had great plenty of milk, yet their
    want of skill was such, they knew not how to make cheese: others so
    simple, they knew not to order their gardens or orchards, or any thing
    belonging thereunto.</i></p>

  <p>Their Countrey also then lay uncultivated, no corn sown: <i>Quævis
    herba &amp; radix cibus est</i>, <i>Their food was herbs and roots</i>
    (saith <i>Dion Cassius</i>.)<span class="sni"><i>Dion li. 62.</i></span> Hence Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i> cals them
    the <i>British Nomades</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Ral. li. 3. c. 5.</i></span> And (by the way) it may not inappositely be
    observ’d, milk, roots, and fruit were the chief banquetting dishes; and
    skins of beasts (if clothed) the most costly habits of our Forefathers.
    Now who can, in reason imagine, that any great knowledge, practice,
    or delight of Arts and Sciences, wherein the elegancy of Architecture
    consists, should be in use or esteem, amongst a people, wholly devoted
    (as I may so say) and given over to such barbarity?</p>

  <p>There were then no publick roads, or common high-ways to passe from one
    place to another, no constant habitations, <i>Nec mœnia, nec urbes</i>,
    <i>Nor towns nor walls</i> (as <i>Dion</i><span class="sni"><i>Dion li. 76.</i></span> out of <i>Xiphiline</i>
    hath it) much lesse <i>Temples</i>, or other buildings made of stone,
    composed by Art, with Order, and Proportion.i</p>

  <p>Moreover, who cast their eies upon this Antiquity, and examine the same
    with judgement, must be enforced to confesse it erected by people,
    grand masters in the Art of building, and liberall sciences, whereof
    the ancient <i>Britans</i> utterly ignorant, as a Nation wholly
    addicted to wars, ne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>ver applying themselves to the study of Arts, or
    troubling their thoughts with any excellency therein. <i>Omnis arbor
    domus.</i><span class="sni"><i>Dion lib. 62.</i></span> <i>Every tree being in stead of a house to them.</i></p>

  <p>In the wars which <i>Bunduica</i> (whom <i>Tacitus</i> cals
    <i>Boadicia</i>) Queen of the <i>Iceni</i>, undertook against the
    <i>Romans</i>, wherein seventy thousand of their Citizens, and
    allies perished; in disdainfull contempt of the experience in Arts,
    wherein the <i>Romans</i> flourished, <i>She</i> accounted it her
    chiefest glory (saith <i>Dion Cassius</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Dion lib. 62.</i></span> to command over the
    <i>Britans</i>, in regard, a people they were, who had not learned,
    or knew, what belonged to the cultivating <i>and manuring of lands;
    or the practice of Arts, or to be craftsmen in any thing, save
    war</i>. <i>Qui non agros colere, non opifices esse, sed bella gerere
    optimè didicerunt.</i> Where you see, their having nor experience nor
    practice in any kinde of Sciences, war excepted, was enforc’d, by
    <i>Bunduica</i>, as redounding greatly to the <i>Britans</i> honour,
    much advantage being made thereof by <i>Her</i>, towards advancing
    <i>Her</i> designs, as the Historian plainly tells us.</p>

  <p>But certain it is, however barbarous in other affairs, a most warlike
    people they were. Never, untill the forces of the whole world united in
    the <i>Roman</i> Empire conspiring to subdue them, liable to conquest:
    neither could all that power, till after numbers of years spent in
    the attempt, with infinite expence of men and treasure, ever prevail
    against them. Now, as their sole skilfulnesse was in war, so they
    idoliz’d principally what had relation thereunto, their <i>Dea optima
    maxima</i>, being <i>Victoria</i>, whom they worshipped under the name
    of <i>Andates</i>. Another Goddesse they had in much esteem, called
    <i>Adraste</i>, which some imagine (as the <i>Nemesis</i> amongst the
    <i>Greeks</i>) was their Goddesse of Revenge. These, according to their
    savage manner of living, they adored in groves, and woods, the only
    <i>Temples</i> in use amongst them, to perform their Sacrifices, and
    divine mysteries in. (as from severall Authors I have already proved)
    Neither find I any particular place mentioned, to which any of these
    their <i>Temples</i> (if they may so be called) were assigned; only
    <i>Andates</i> (it seems from <i>Dion Cassius</i>) had a grove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> sacred
    to her in the Countrey of the <i>Iceni</i>, anciently containing
    <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, <i>Cambridge</i>, and <i>Huntingdon</i>
    Shires, farre enough from <i>Stoneheng</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides, it is not to be past over in silence, how <i>Tacitus</i>
    expresseth himself in the before cited fourteenth Book of his Annals,
    telling us; <i>The</i> Romans <i>overthrew not the Temples, or
    razed to the Foundations, any of the sacred structures of the</i>
    Druid’s <i>and</i> Britans <i>made of stone, or other materials,
    which he might as readily have done, if they had used any such: but
    positively, the</i> Romans <i>cut down the</i> Britans <i>woods and
    groves, amongst them reckoned holy, and consecrated to their execrable
    superstitions</i>. True it is, other Temples, of greater magnificence
    then already spoken of, I find none: Ornaments of Art to enrich
    them they were not acquainted with: such orderly composed works as
    <i>Stoneheng</i>, they had not any: yea, no kind of sacred structures
    of stone were in use amongst them: their idolatrous places being
    naturally adorned, only with wild, and overgrown shades, designed and
    brought to perfection by Dame Nature her self, she being Architect
    generall to all their Deities. Nor did it consist with their vain
    Religion to use any other, they making their worship, performing their
    Ceremonies, offering their Sacrifices in dark and obscure groves, most
    conformable unto their barbarous, and inhumane, humane oblations.</p>

  <p>Neither must it seem strange, they used no other Temples then these,
    it not being their custom alone; for the <i>Excelsi</i><span class="sni"><i>Mayer. 1 K. 1. Ch.</i></span> or high places
    mentioned in the sacred Story, wherein the Heathen performed idolatrous
    rites unto their Idols, were commonly groves, affectedly sited upon
    some mountainous place, without any <i>House</i> or <i>Temple</i>. The
    <i>Persians</i> of old, (of whom <i>Herodotus</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Herod. li. 1.</i></span> <i>Neque statuas,
    neque templa, neque aras extruere consuetudo est</i>, <i>Erected
    neither Images, nor Temples, nor Altars</i>: <i>quinimo hoc facientibus
    insaniæ tribuere</i>, <i>accounting it great folly and madnesse in
    those that did</i>: but ascending to the tops of the highest, and most
    lofty hils, on them offered sacrifices to their Gods. From hence,
    <i>Xerxes</i>, in his expedition, burnt down the Temples of the
    <i>Greeks</i>, because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> shut up their Gods therein, to whom all
    things are open and free, and to whom the whole Universe serves for a
    Temple. The <i>Abasgians</i> also (inhabiting Mount <i>Caucasus</i>)
    did worship, even till <i>Procopius</i> his time, groves and woods;
    and in a barbarian simplicity esteemed the very trees themselves
    to be Gods. In like manner, the Northern and Southern people of
    <i>America</i>, made all their Invocations and Exorcisms in woods. The
    ancient <i>Germans</i> likewise consecrated woods and forests. <i>Lucos
    ac nemora consecrant</i>, saith <i>Tacitus</i> of them. And the like
    places for idolatrous superstition, did divers other barbarous Nations
    use, before reduced to order, and civility of life, <i>Tacitus</i>
    giving this reason for it: They thought it a matter ill beseeming the
    greatnesse of their Deities, to enclose them within Temples made by
    Art. His words are, <i>Nec cohibere parietibus Deos arbitrantur</i>,
    <i>They thought it not fit to restrain their Deities within compacted
    walls</i>: <i>id est, neque templis, neque domibus</i>, viz. <i>neither
    within Temples or Houses made with hands</i>, as <i>C. Pichenas</i>
    commenting thereon more fully interprets.</p>

  <p>Touching the manner of the buildings of the ancient <i>Britans</i>,
    and of what materialls they consisted, I find them so far short of
    the magnificence of this Antiquity, that they were nor stately,
    nor sumptuous; neither had they any thing of <i>Order</i>, or
    <i>Symmetry</i>, much lesse, of gracefulnesse, and <i>Decorum</i> in
    them, being only such as <i>Ovid</i><span class="sni"><i>Ovid. Met. lib. 1.</i></span> (relating to the first Age of the
    world) makes mention of.</p>

  <p class="noindent">To like purpose <i>Vitruvius</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Vitru. lib. 2.</i></span> <i>In the first Age of the World</i>
    (saith he) <i>men lived in woods, caves, and forests, but after they
    had found out the use of fire, and by the benefit thereof were invited
    to enter into a cer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>tain kind of society</i>, <i>cœperunt alii de
    fronde facere tecta, alii speluncas fodere sub montibus, nonnulli
    hirundinum nidos, &amp; ædificationes earum imitantes, de luto &amp; virgultis
    facere loca, quæ subirent</i>. <i>Some of them began to make themselves
    habitations of boughs, some to dig dens in mountains; other some,
    imitating the nests of birds, made themselves places of lome and twigs,
    and such like materials, to creep into, and shroud themselves in.</i>
    Directly after which manner of workmanship, were the houses of the
    ancient <i>Britans</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Domos ex calamis aut lignis ut plurimum habent compactas</i>.
    <i>Their houses for the most part are of reed and wood</i>, saith<span class="sni"><i>Diodo. li. 6.</i></span>
    <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>.</p>

  <p>In the Northern parts they live in tents. <i>Degunt in tentoriis</i>,
    (saith <i>Dion</i>, epitomis’d by <i>Xiphiline</i>.)</p>

  <p>Their Cities were without walls, the Country without Towns. <i>Urbium
    loco ipsis sunt nemora</i>, (saith <i>Strabo</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Strab. lib. 4.</i></span> <i>woods stand them
    in stead of Cities or Towns</i>. <i>Arboribus enim dejectis ubi amplum
    circulum sepierunt, ipsi casas ibidem sibi ponunt, &amp; pecori stabula
    condunt, ad usum quidem non longi temporis.</i> <i>For when by felling
    of trees, they have inclosed, and fenced therewith a large circuit
    of wood, therein they raise cabbins and cottages for themselves, and
    hovels for their cattell, of no great continuance, but only to supply
    their present use and occasion.</i></p>

  <p><i>Opidum Britanni vocant</i> (saith <i>Cæsar</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Cæsar. lib. 5.</i></span> <i>quum silvas
    impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt, quo incursionis hostium vitandæ
    causa, convenire consueverunt</i>, <i>The</i> Britans <i>call a thick
    wood, enclosed about with a ditch and rampire, made for a place of
    retreat to avoid the invasion and assault of their bordering enemies, a
    Town</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus, you see, in what condition the Inhabitants of this Island lived
    in those ancient times, having of themselves, neither desire, nor
    ability to exercise, nor from others, encouragement to attain whatever
    knowledge in the Art of Building. Precepts, and rules therein, the
    <i>Druid’s</i> neither could, nor would impart unto them. That they
    could not, appears from what is formerly said, and in what skilfull
    above others, they communicated nothing, but to those of their own
    society, <i>taking speciall order</i> (as <i>Cæsar</i> affirms)
    <i>their discipline might not be divulged</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

  <p>As for Colonies of any Nation practised in Arts, from whom they might
    receive or knowledge, or civil conversation, there were none setled
    amongst them: neither had they commerce, or traffique, with any
    people experienced therein, much lesse acquaintance with any other,
    except those of <i>Gaul</i>, welnear as barbarous as themselves.
    <i>None of the</i> Gauls <i>in a manner, had any knowledge</i> (saith
    <i>Cæsar</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Cæsar. lib. 4.</i></span> <i>of the nature and quality of the people of</i>
    Britain, <i>or of the places, ports, or passes of the Countrey</i>.
    <i>Neque enim temerè præter mercatores illò adit quisquam, neque iis
    ipsis quidquam, præter oram maritimam, atque eas regiones quæ sunt
    contra Galliam, notum est.</i> For, <i>not any went thither without
    eminent danger, except merchants, and they also could give accompt
    of nothing, save only the Sea-coast, and those Countreys which were
    opposite to</i> Gaul. <i>Never any Colony of the</i> Greeks, <i>for
    ought I know</i> (saith <i>Ortelius</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Ortel. descr. Fr.</i></span> <i>was seated in</i> Britain.
    <i>And</i> Cæsar, <i>the first of all the</i> Romans <i>that discovered
    it</i>, saith <i>Camden</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Camden fo. 2.</i></span></p>

  <p>If desire neverthelesse, to know in what times the ancient
    <i>Britans</i> began to be civilized, when to learn the knowledge
    of <i>Arts</i>, to build stately <i>Temples</i>, <i>Palaces</i>,
    <i>publick Buildings</i>, to be eloquent in forrain languages, and by
    their habits, and attire, attain the qualities of a civil, and well
    ordered people, <i>Tacitus</i> shall relate the same.</p>

  <p><i>Sequens hiems saluberrimis conciliis absumpta</i> &amp;c. <i>The
    winter ensuing</i> (being the second year of <i>Julius Agricola</i>
    his <i>Proprætorship</i>, or Leivtenancy in <i>Britan</i>; <i>Titus
    Vespasian</i> Emperour, about one hundred thirty three years after
    the first discovery thereof by <i>Cæsar</i>) <i>was spent in most
    profitable, and politick Councels</i> (saith <i>Tacitus</i>.)<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. in vit. Agr.</i></span> <i>For,
    whereas the</i> Britans <i>were rude, and dispersed, and thereby
    prone, upon every occasion, to warre</i>; Agricola, <i>to induce
    them by pleasure to quietnesse and rest, exhorted in private, and
    helpt them in common to build Temples, Houses, and places of publick
    resort, commending those, that were forward therein, and punishing
    the refractory. Moreover, the Noblemens sons he took, and instructed
    in the liberall Sciences, preferring the wits of</i> Britain, <i>to
    the students in</i> Gaul, <i>as being now eagerly ambitious to attain
    the eloquence of the</i> Roman <i>tongue, whereas lately they utterly
    rejected that language. After that, our attire grew in account, and
    the gown much used amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> them, and so by little and little they
    proceeded to provocations of vices, to sumptuous galleries, baths,
    and exquisite banquettings.</i> Thus far <i>Tacitus</i>. Now had
    there been but the least mention made, by any Author, concerning the
    <i>Druid’s</i> instructing, and training up the ancient <i>Britans</i>
    in any such matters, as these, (which <i>Tacitus</i> remembers the
    <i>Romans</i> to have done) what conclusions might have been rais’d
    from them? what presumptive reasons drawn, to prove, <i>Stoneheng</i> a
    work of the <i>Druid’s</i>, or at least erected for their use?</p>

  <p>To conclude, if this authority from <i>Tacitus</i> only, (an Author
    esteem’d the <i>Polybius</i> of the <i>Latines</i>) be throughly
    weighed, it will evidently manifest, (whatever else hath formerly
    been delivered) there was no such thing in <i>Britain</i>, before the
    <i>Romans</i> arrived here, as that which we now call <i>Stoneheng</i>.
    What credit else with posterity could <i>Tacitus</i> expect to gain, in
    affirming the <i>Britans</i> were taught and instructed in the liberall
    Sciences by the <i>Romans</i>; if those <i>Arts</i> acknowledg’d, to
    be practis’d amongst the <i>Britans</i> before? What need to have
    told us, the <i>Romans</i> made them skilfull in erecting sumptuous
    <i>Palaces</i>, stately <i>Portico’s</i>, and publick places, if the
    inhabitants here, accustomed to enjoy such noble buildings, before the
    <i>Romans</i> arrivall in this Land? Why, tell succeeding Ages, when
    gentle persuasions not prevail, to make the <i>Britans</i> innovate,
    and admit of sacred structures to whatever Deities, <i>Agricola</i>
    compelled them to found magnificent <i>Temples</i>, and assist therein,
    if this Antiquity <i>Stoneheng</i> extant before those times? Why
    also, should the <i>Britans</i> look upon the <i>Temple</i> erected
    by the <i>Romans</i> at <i>Camalodunum</i>, (supposed <i>Maldon</i>
    in <i>Essex</i>) in honour of <i>Claudius</i> sacred memory, as an
    <i>Altar of perpetuall dominion</i> over them, if been used to such
    structures before? yea, such an eye-sore the <i>Britans</i> accounted
    it, as, that <i>Temple</i> was one of the principall causes, which gave
    birth to that fatall insurrection under <i>Boadicia</i>. Neither would
    <i>Tacitus</i> have magnified the introducing those customs amongst
    them, as admirable policy in <i>Agricola</i>, and the true and only
    rule to bring them from their rude, and dispersed manner of living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> to
    civility, if the <i>Britans</i> attain’d such discipline before, or any
    knowledge in the excellency of <i>Architecture</i> preceding the time
    of the <i>Romans</i> government here. No, for what saith <i>Camden</i>?<span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo. 63.</i></span>
    <i>It was the brightnesse of that most glorious Empire, which chased
    away all savage Barbarism from the</i> Britans <i>minds, like as from
    other Nations, whom it had subdued.</i></p>

  <p>Furthermore, in the time of this <i>Agricola</i>, <i>Britain</i> was
    fully discovered, the <i>Romans</i> had circumnavigated it, and knew,
    for certain, it was an Island, formerly doubted of till his time; yea,
    there was not a Port (as I may so say) a bay, mountain, valley, hill,
    plain, wood, or forest, either any custom, rite, ceremony, or what else
    belonging to the knowledge of the Countrey, or manners of the People,
    but the <i>Romans</i> were then as well acquainted with (especially, in
    that part of the Island now call’d <i>England</i>) as, at this day, the
    Inhabitants themselves are. Neverthelesse, what mention soever is made
    by their Historians, concerning other matters of the <i>Britans</i>,
    not one word is to be found of this Antiquity, or any building of this
    kind in use amongst them. But, because some curiously learned have
    desired somwhat to be spoken for their better satisfaction touching
    this particular, I have been too prolixe. In a word therefore, let it
    suffice, <i>Stoneheng</i> was no work of the <i>Druid’s</i>, or of the
    ancient <i>Britans</i>; the learning of the <i>Druid’s</i> consisting
    more in contemplation then practice, and the ancient <i>Britans</i>
    accounting it their chiefest glory to be wholly ignorant in whatever
    Arts. Neither could it be otherwise, seeing <i>their life so uncivil,
    so rude, so full of wars, and consequently void of all literature</i>.
    (as <i>Camden</i> relateth)<span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo. 4.</i></span></p>

  <p>Yet, before I come to speak of this middle Age (if I may so call it)
    wherein the <i>Romans</i> prevailed, and to compleat their victories
    gave first rise to civility in this Island; as, I began with times of
    great Antiquity, so must I now descend to those lesse ancient, and
    modern, wherein, as posterity hath suffered an irreparable damage,
    through want of writing in those first times, so hath it been almost
    at as great a losse, by too much writing in later times; so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
    Authors, so much contrariety, so little certainty is found amongst
    them. Who, when they could not search out the truth in deed, laboured
    to bring forth narrations invented by themselves, without or reason, or
    authority: delivering (saith <i>Camden</i>) their severall opinions,
    rather with a certain pleasant variety to give contentment to their
    <i>Readers</i>, then with any care or judgement to find out the truth
    of things.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>THOSE ancient Historians who (among other actions of the
    <i>Britans</i>) treat of this Antiquity, differ much in their severall
    reports. And, as it is usuall with <i>Historiographers</i> of other
    Nations, where, they cannot give a just and rationall accompt of
    unwonted accidents, beyond the common course of things, to fill up
    their stories with fabulous, and incredible relations; so, no marvell,
    if we hear the like in our own Histories.<span class="sni"><i>Leyland. de assert. Arth. fo. 35.</i></span> <i>Credibile enim est
    calamitatem bellicam, quæ ecclesias unà cum bibliochecis exhauserat
    infinitis, clara vetustatis monumenta abrasisse. For evident it is,
    through the calamities of wars</i> (saith <i>Leyland</i>) <i>which
    together with infinite Libraries ruined the Churches themselves,
    the certain records of our Antiquities, are utterly lost. Unde
    scripturienti de antiquitate</i> Britannica <i>occultissima, pleraque
    omnia. Whereby the Writers of the</i> British <i>Stories, are all of
    them, for the most part, very obscure and doubtfull.</i>r</p>

  <p>Some others again, especially the most ancient and authentick
    <i>British</i> Historians, who liv’d in Ages next succeeding those,
    wherein, <i>Stoneheng</i> might probably be first erected, have wholly
    passed it over with silence. In like manner venerable <i>Bede</i>,
    <i>William Malmesbury</i>, <i>Roger Hoveden</i>, and others, speak
    nothing thereof, as happily, willing rather to decline it altogether,
    then deliver it upon frivolous conjectures, and in so doing cast a
    blemish upon their other labours. Neither is it improbable, that the
    most ancient Authors, considering the times wherein they wrote, upon
    the first springing up of <i>Christian Religion</i> here, might through
    zeal unto the true God, forbear to commemorate unto posterity, places
    designed for idolatrous uses; endea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>vouring rather, to suppresse the
    memory thereof, and make succeeding generations sollicitous therein;
    then, in that infancy of Divine worship, to illustrate the magnificence
    of the Heathens, for building such notable structures to their false
    Gods. Insomuch, I find very little, or no mention at all thereof in
    the <i>British</i> Stories, except by <i>Geffrey Monmouth</i>, with
    some who follow him, and by such Authors only, as our most judicious
    Writers hold in many things, either meerly fabulous, or overladen with
    malicious, or accidentary untruths. Such relations neverthelesse,
    as they make thereof, I shall endeavour to deliver in their own
    words, reduceable into two conjectures, <i>viz.</i> either that
    <i>Stoneheng</i> was erected by <i>A. Ambrosius</i> (in ancient times
    King of the <i>Britans</i>) in memory of the <i>British</i> Nobility
    perfidiously slain at a treaty by <i>Hengist</i> the <i>Saxon</i>: or
    else, set up by the <i>Britans</i> themselves in honour of Him their
    said King.</p>

  <p><i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>, curiously diligent in his relations of
    the miracles in <i>Ireland</i>, amongst other strange things in those
    parts, reckons up this Antiquity <i>Stoneheng</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Gir. Camb. de adm. Hib. Cap. 18.</i></span> <i>Fuit antiquis
    temporibus in</i> Hibernia, <i>lapidum congeries admiranda</i>, (saith
    he) <i>quæ &amp;</i> Chorea Gigantum <i>dicta fuit, quia Gigantes eam ab
    ultimis</i> Africæ <i>partibus in</i> Hiberniam <i>attulerunt &amp;c.
    There was in</i> Ireland <i>in ancient times, a pile of stones worthy
    admiration, called the</i> Giants Dance, <i>because Giants, from the
    remotest parts of</i> Africa, <i>brought them into</i> Ireland, <i>and
    in the plains of</i> Kildare, <i>not farre from the Castle of the</i>
    Naase, <i>as well by force of Art, as strength, miraculously set them
    up. These stones</i> (according to the <i>British</i> story) Aurelius
    Ambrosius, <i>King of the</i> Britans, <i>procured</i> Merlin <i>by
    supernaturall means to bring from Ireland, into</i> Britain. <i>And,
    that he might leave some famous monument of so great a treason to
    after ages, in the same order, and art, as they stood formerly, set
    them up, where the flower of the</i> British <i>Nation fell by the
    cut-throat practice of the</i> Saxons, <i>and where under the pretence
    of peace, the ill secured youth of the Kingdom, by murdrous designs
    were slain</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Rainulph</i> Monk of <i>Chester</i>, speaking of <i>Aurelius</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Polychr. li. 5.</i></span>
    alias <i>Aurelianus Ambrosius</i> (by others called <i>Ambrosius
    Aurelianus</i>) saith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> (as Sir <i>John Trevisa</i> the Priest in old
    English laid it down) <span class="blackletter">His brother Uter Pendragon by help of Merlin
    the Prophet brought</span> Choream Gigantum, <span class="blackletter">that is Stonehenges out of
    Ireland. Stonehenge is now in the plain of Salisbury: of that bringing
    of Stonehenge out of Ireland, speaketh the British story, if it should
    lawfully be ytrowed.</span></p>

  <p>It appears, <i>Rainulph</i> of <i>Chester</i>, as easie credit as he
    gave to strange stories, had not much confidence in this: and if,
    according to <i>Geffrey Monmouth</i>, or <i>Matthew Westminster</i>, I
    should set it down, I presume you would be of his mind. But, I affect
    not such conceits, they are neither fitting my discourse, nor your
    perusall. Neverthelesse, seeing none of them tell us, by what ways,
    or Arts, Giants (as they will have it) brought them from the remotest
    parts of <i>Africk</i> into <i>Ireland</i> (for it seems they could
    not hansomly find a <i>Merlin</i> to help them therein also) I shall
    take so much leave, following <i>Geffrey Monmouths</i> steps, as to
    give you, at least, some part of the story, and relate (according
    to their opinions) how they came from <i>Ireland</i> hither. After
    <i>Geffrey Monmouths</i> discourse of <i>Uter Pendragons</i> victory
    over the <i>Irish</i>, who with <i>Merlin</i> forsooth and a great
    Army, were sent by <i>A. Ambrosius</i> to fetch the Giants dance,
    <i>Lapidum structuram adepti</i> (saith he) <i>gavisi sunt &amp; admirati;
    circumstantibus itaque cunctis, accessit</i> Merlinus <i>&amp; ait, utimini
    viribus vestris juvenes, ut in deponendo lapides istos, sciatis utrum
    ingenium virtuti, aut virtus ingenio cedat, &amp;c.</i> i.e. <i>Having
    found the structure, from joy they fell into admiration, and standing
    all of them at gaze round about it</i>, Merlin <i>draws near, and
    thus bespeaks them: Use now your utmost strength young men, that in
    taking away these stones, you may discover, whether Art to strength,
    or strength gives place to Art. At his command therefore, they bring
    severall sorts of engines, and addresse themselves to pulling it down.
    Some ropes, some cables, some had made lathers ready, that what they
    so much desired, might be effected, but in no wise able to atcheive
    their purpose. Deficientibus cunctis, solutus est</i> Merlinus <i>in
    risum</i> (saith <i>Geffrey</i>) <i>&amp; suas machinationes confecit.
    Denique cum quæque necessaria apposuisset; leviùs quàm credi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> potest

    &amp; sic cum gaudio in</i> Britanniam <i>reverti cœperunt. All of them
    tired</i>, Merlin <i>breaks out into laughter, and provides his
    engines. Lastly, when he had set all things in a readinesse, hardly to
    be beleev’d it is, with what facility he took them down: being taken
    down, he caused them to be carried to the Ships, and imbarqued; and so
    with joy they began their return towards</i> Britain. Leaving it for us
    to suppose, with as small labour they were imbarqued, dis-imbarqued,
    and brought from their landing place to <i>Salisbury</i> plain: all (it
    seems) done by <i>Merlins</i> spels. But of this too much.</p>

  <p>Neverthelesse, as I contemne fables, so doe I imbrace, and take
    pleasure in the truth of History: and therefore, that which
    concerns the slaughter of the <i>British</i> Nobility by treason of
    <i>Hengist</i> commander of the <i>Saxons</i>, as of greater moment,
    and truth, I shall more fully relate. And <i>Geffrey Monmouth’s</i>
    Authority in this treacherous slaughter of the <i>Britans</i>,
    though I respect not so much, as <i>Ninnius</i>, <i>Malmsbury</i>,
    <i>Sigebert</i>, and others that affirm the same; yet, because he
    was the first, after so many, and so ancient Authors, that father’d
    <i>Stoneheng</i> their monument, and <i>A. Ambrosius</i> founder
    thereof, and therefore must trace him, and his followers therein.
    I will give you the history likewise from him, and thus it was:
    <i>Hengist</i>, upon his return with new supplies into <i>Britain</i>,
    finding <i>Vortigern</i> beyond expectation restored to the Crown,
    and withall greatly alienated in his affections towards him, prepared
    for his defence, with force of arms. But, whether he thought himself
    too weak; or, that he rather sought to be especially revenged on the
    <i>British</i> Nobility, who had wholly unriveted his designs, or both;
    he thought it no difficult matter to delude him by a Treaty, whom
    formerly he had so easily beguiled with his Neece <i>Rowena</i>. To
    which purpose, he makes an overture, to compose the enmities betwixt
    them at a Parley; and the King accepting it, appoints <i>Ambresbury</i>
    Town their meeting place, <i>Nec mora, statuta die instante convenerunt
    omnes intra nominatam urbem</i> (saith <i>Geffrey</i>)<span class="sni"><i>G. Mon. li. 6.</i></span> <i>&amp; de pace
    habenda colloquium inceperunt. Ut igitur horam proditioni suæ idoneam
    inspexisset</i> Hengistus, <i>vocife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>ratus est</i>, <span class="blackletter">Nemet oure
    saxas</span>: <i>&amp; ilico</i> Vortigernum <i>accepit, &amp; per pallium
    detinuit. Audito ocyùs signo, abstraxerunt</i> (i.e. <i>eduxerunt</i>)
    Saxones <i>cultros suos, &amp; astantes principes invaserunt, ipsósque
    nihil tale præmeditantes jugulaverunt circiter quadringentos sexaginta
    inter Barones &amp; Consules. The prefixed day being come, they all,
    without delay, met in the aforesaid Town, and began their Treaty for
    Peace; when therefore</i> Hengist <i>saw fit time for execution of his
    intended Treason, he cried out, giving the word</i>, <span class="blackletter">Nemet oure
    saxas</span> (<span class="blackletter">Nem eowr seaxes</span> (saith Verstegan)<span class="sni"><i>Verstegan Ch. 5.</i></span> that is, <i>Take
    your</i> <span class="blackletter">seaxes</span>; a kind of crooked knives, which each of the
    <i>Saxons</i> then carried closely in his pocket) <i>and forthwith
    seised upon</i> Vortigern, <i>and held him by his robe. The</i> Saxons
    <i>quickly hearing it, drew forth their knives, and fell upon the</i>
    Britans <i>standing by, of whom, part Noblemen, part officers of State,
    expecting no such design, they slew four hundred and sixty. Quorum
    corpora beatus</i> Eldadus <i>postmodum sepelivit, atque Christiano
    more humavit, haud longè à</i> <span class="blackletter">Kaer-caradane</span>, <i>quæ nunc</i>
    Salesberia <i>dicitur, in cœmeterio, quod est juxta cœnobium</i>
    Ambrii. <i>Whose corpses holy</i> Eldad, <i>according to custome, after
    Christian manner interred, not far from</i> <span class="blackletter">Kaer-caradane</span>,
    <i>now called</i> Salisbury, <i>in the Churchyard adjoyning to the
    monastery of</i> Ambresbury.</p>

  <p>With this relation of the <i>Saxons</i> treachery, <i>Mathew
    Westminster</i><span class="sni"><i>Ma. West. fo. 84.</i></span> (in his <i>Flores historiarum</i>) seems to agree.
    And it wholly destroys the opinion commonly received, That the said
    Treaty with the <i>Saxons</i>, the massacre of the <i>Britans</i>,
    and likewise their interment, were at <i>Stoneheng</i>; and that in
    memory, those matters so transacted there, <i>A. Ambrosius</i> in
    the same place erected this Antiquity. Wherefore, I much wonder, our
    modern historians should cite the aforesaid Authors<span class="sni"><i>Hollinsh. l. 5.<br />Speed lib. 7.<br />Stow fo. 53. 4<sup>to</sup>.</i></span> in confirmation
    thereof, especially, when they affirm directly, the treaty was held in
    <i>Ambresbury</i> Town, and that the <i>British</i> Nobility fell by
    Treason there. <i>Jussit</i> Vortigernus <i>&amp; cives &amp;</i> Saxones Maiis
    <i>Kalendis, quæ jam instare incipiebant, juxta</i> Ambrii <i>cœnobium
    convenire</i> (saith <i>G. Monmouth</i>)<span class="sni"><i>G. Monm. lib. 5.</i></span> Vortigern <i>commanded both
    his own people, and the</i> Saxons, <i>upon the Calends of</i> May
    <i>then approaching, to appear near to the Monastery of</i> Ambresbury.
    <i>In Pago</i> Ambri <i>convenire, to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> in the Town it self of</i>
    Ambresbury (saith <i>Mathew Westminster</i>) In order to which summons,
    (that I may proceed with <i>Geffrey Monmouths</i> story explaining
    himself positively concerning the place) <i>statuta die instante
    convenerunt omnes intra nominatam urbem, &amp;c. the appointed day being
    come, all of them met together within the forenamed Town, and there
    treated</i>. The issue whereof was, that upon the word given (as before
    related) <i>The</i> Saxons <i>drew their knives, and falling upon
    the</i> Britans <i>standing by, slew them</i>. And, lest posterity
    should doubt those sacrificed for their Countreys cause neglected in
    their funerals, he leaves not there, but gives us the direct place,
    and manner of their buriall, affirming plainly they were buried by a
    Metropolitane of those times, even in a Church-yard, as Christians
    should. <i>In cœmeterio, quod est juxta cœnobium, In the Church-yard,
    close by the Monastery.</i> (saith he) There is not one word mentioned
    (I pray observe) of <i>Salisbury plain</i>, where this <i>Antiquity
    Stoneheng</i> remains, throughout all their Story.</p>

  <p>But, it’s objected, although they were buried at the Monastery, the
    monument for their memory might be set up elsewhere, in a place more
    proper, and more conspicuous; even, as in the most properly conspicuous
    places where great actions happened <i>Trophies</i> were erected by
    the <i>Romans</i>, whose customs <i>A. Ambrosius</i> living long
    time amongst them, knew very well. I answer, <i>A. Ambrosius</i>,
    is suppos’d by <i>Bede</i>, and the best Authors, descended from
    the <i>Romans</i>; who, living many years under their subjection,
    in forrain parts, had fully inform’d his judgement, no doubt, with
    whatever customs, civill or martiall, then in use amongst them.
    For, though the <i>Romans</i> in those times, had utterly lost all
    knowledge of Arts, questionlesse civill, and martiall customs in
    some sort continued with them. Neverthelesse, if <i>A. Ambrosius</i>
    did erect any monument for the <i>British</i> Nobility, he rather,
    doubtlesse endeavoured to observe the rules of his own Religion, being
    a Christian, then the Heathenish customs of his Ancestors. However, in
    erecting it, at the place of their interment, he pursued both. As for
    the Christians honouring to posterity their famous men after death,
    it being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> so well known, I need not relate it. And, as concerning the
    ancient <i>Romans</i> manner in burying their Emperours, and those that
    had triumphed, or otherwise deserved well of the Common-wealth, though
    they burned their bodies abroad, the place for sepulture of their
    Ashes,<span class="sni"><i>Thomas. Procachio fo. 46.</i></span> was within the City, monuments to their memory being erected,
    upon the same place where buried; so was <i>Publicola</i> honoured, so
    the <i>Fabritii</i>, the <i>Cæsars</i>, and others. And, after the same
    fashion it seems, was the monument for the <i>British</i> Nobility (if
    any) set up where they were interred; as in the place of all others
    most proper for it, all the considerable circumstances touching their
    deaths, happening there in like manner.</p>

  <p>It’s true the <i>Romans</i> set up <i>Trophies</i> for great Victories,
    in the most eminent places where those victories were obtained by
    them; as the <i>Trophy</i> for <i>Caius Marius</i> his vanquishing
    the <i>Cimbrians</i>, in the most notable place where that memorable
    field was fought. Also, the <i>Trophy</i> dedicated to the memory of
    <i>Augustus Cæsar</i> that by his happy conduct, all the <i>Alpine</i>
    Nations, were reduced to <i>Roman</i> obedience, was erected in the
    most conspicuous place of the <i>Alps</i>. Now, this martiall custome
    considered, the <i>British</i> Nobility being (as the aforesaid
    Historians maintain) slaughtered in the Town, and buried at the
    Monastery adjoyning. Some one of those high hils, on either side
    <i>Ambresbury</i>, had certainly for site been more eminent, and
    the monument it self more exposed to the daily view of travellers,
    then about two miles from the Town, in a place remote, where this
    <i>Antiquity</i> stands. Which, though indeed eminent of it self, and
    overlooking the plains adjoyning; yet, at a large distance, especially
    on that side towards <i>Ambresbury</i>, and <i>Salisbury</i>-ward, is
    so surrounded with hils; as it appears with an Aspect of Religious
    horror, rather then as carrying any form of whatever sepulture.</p>

  <p>This, though sufficient to refute the preceding objection (the
    former reasons being grounded upon customs only) I shall yet, from
    the histories of those times, further answer thereunto; <i>Mathew
    Westminster</i> tels us,<span class="sni"><i>Math. West. fo. 92.</i></span> <i>A. Ambrosius</i> having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> compleated his
    victories over <i>Hengist</i>, and subdued his sons at <i>York</i>;
    <i>Deinde porrexisse ad monasterium</i> Ambri, <i>ubi principes
    defuncti jacebant, quos</i> Hengistus <i>prodiderat; from thence
    came to the Monastery at</i> Ambresbury, <i>where the deceased
    Nobles, whom</i> Hengist <i>betrayed, lay buried.</i> And <i>Geffrey
    Monmouth</i>,<span class="sni"><i>G. Mon. li. 8.</i></span> prosecuting the same story, affirms also, that <i>A.
    Ambrosius</i> being come to the Monastery, <i>ut locum quo defuncti
    jacebant circumspexit, pietate motus in lachrymas solutus est, dignum
    namque memoria censebat cespitem, qui tot nobiles pro patria defunctos
    protegebat. So soon as he cast his eyes upon the place where the
    slaughtered Princes lay interred, deplored them; esteeming that very
    ground which covered so many Nobles, dying for their Countreys cause,
    worthy eternall memory.</i> Upon this consideration, <i>Præcepit</i>
    Merlino (saith the same Author) <i>lapides circa sepulturam erigere,
    quos ex</i> Hibernia <i>asportaverat</i>. A. Ambrosius <i>commanded</i>
    Merlin, <i>that the stones brought out of</i> Ireland (for he still
    troubles himself and readers therewith) <i>should be erected about the
    place of their buriall</i>. Whereby it clearly appears their Sepulchre
    was set up about the same place where they were buried, and not
    elsewhere. Also, as fully that their buriall place (as both the said
    Historians have told us) was at the Monastery of <i>Ambresbury</i>,
    or Churchyard adjoyning to it. All which former circumstances duly
    weighed, ’tis not possible <i>Stoneheng</i> should be supposed their
    Monument; except <i>Geffrey Monmouth</i>, having made so formall a tale
    of their easie transportation from <i>Ireland</i>, would compell us
    also to imagine, posterity might as easily be induced to assent, they
    were in like manner removed from the Churchyard at <i>Ambresbury</i>
    to <i>Salisbury</i> plain, the one being equally as ridiculous as the
    other, and no manner of credit to be given to either.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, laying all the aforesaid Authorities together. First, that
    <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i> formerly cited, tells us, (in that part
    of his story which carries most likelihood of truth) a Monument was
    set up by <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, in memory of the <i>Britans</i>, slain
    at a Treaty by the <i>Saxons</i>, upon the very same place <i>where
    slain</i>; and in order thereunto the aforesaid <i>Bri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>tish</i>
    Historians unanimously affirming the place at which that treaty was
    held, and where those <i>Britans were slain</i> was the Town it self of
    <i>Ambresbury</i>, not where this <i>Antiquity Stoneheng</i> remains:
    again, if suspect <i>Cambrensis</i> authority, and allow rather what our
    Historiographer of <i>Monmouth</i> saith, That the Monument was erected
    by <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, upon that plat of ground, where the slaughtered
    <i>Britans lay buryed</i>; he telling us also, their <i>buriall
    place</i> was in the Churchyard of the Monastery at <i>Ambresbury</i>
    (at the Monastery it self, saith <i>Matthew Westminster</i>) certainly
    then their Monument (whatsoever it was) being set up at the place,
    where they were both slain and buried, and (according to the aforesaid
    Authors) they being nor slain nor buryed at <i>Stoneheng</i>, it must
    necessarily follow, this <i>Antiquity</i> was not erected in Honour
    of those <i>Britans</i>. Unlesse any man will undertake to prove
    (which most certain it is none can) <i>Stoneheng</i> stands now, where
    <i>Ambresbury</i> stood of old: or that the Monastery and Churchyard
    thereof were not at <i>Ambresbury</i>, but at <i>Stoneheng</i>.</p>

  <p>That the Monastery of three hundred Monks,<span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo.</i> 254.</span> stood there, (to wit
    at <i>Ambresbury</i>) <i>Camden</i>, out of the Book called
    <i>Eulogium</i>, affirms. And, that the Churchyard was close adjoyning
    to it, there’s no question to be made. First, because in all times
    since Monasteries erected, it was always in use, to lay out places for
    Churchyards belonging to them, near to the Monasteries themselves.
    Secondly, because divers Sepulchres, upon severall occasions, broken
    up at <i>Ambresbury</i> Monastery, manifest the same. Thirdly,
    because <i>Geffrey Monmouth</i> plainly tels us, they were buried in
    <i>cœmeterio, quod est juxta cœnobium</i>; <i>in the Churchyard which
    is close by the Monastery</i>. Lastly, it is further confirmed by
    these his formerly recited words,<span class="sni"><i>G. Monm. lib. 6. &amp; 8.</i></span> <i>A. Ambrosius being come unto the
    Monastery, cast his eyes upon the place where the slaughtered Princes
    lay interred</i>. Which is not possible he should have done, if the
    Churchyard had been at <i>Stoneheng</i>; it being very well known
    <i>Stoneheng</i> cannot be discerned, even from the highest hils, upon
    those parts especially, that next surround <i>Ambresbury</i>, much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
    lesse from the Monastery it self, sited in the bottome of a deep vale
    by the river <i>Avons</i> side.</p>

  <p>Among other Sepulchres found at the said Monastery, it’s worthy memory,
    that about the beginning of this Century, one of them hewn out of a
    firm stone, and placed in the middle of a wall, was opened, having upon
    its coverture in rude letters of massie gold,</p>

  <div class="sni">The originall Inscription I could not procure; such relation
    thereof neverthelesse as came to my hands, I have, upon credit of those
    persons of quality from whom received, inserted it here.</div>

  <div class="center mt2 mb2"><i>R. G. A. C.</i> 600.</div>

  <p class="noindent">The bones within which Sepulchre were all firm, fair yellow coloured
    hair about the scull, a supposed peece of the liver, near upon the
    bignesse of a walnut, very dry and hard, and together therewith,
    were found severall royall habiliments, as jewels, veils, scarfs,
    and the like, retaining even till then, their proper colours. All
    which were afterwards, very choicely kept, in the collection of the
    Right honourable <i>Edward</i>, then Earl of <i>Hertford</i>: and of
    the aforesaid gold divers rings were made and worn by his Lordships
    principall Officers. Concerning which Tomb (though I list not dispute)
    why might it not be the Sepulchre of Queen <i>Guinever</i>, wife
    of King <i>Arthur</i>; especially the Letters <i>R G.</i> as much
    to say, <i>Regina Guinevera</i>, declaring her title and name; and
    the date <i>An. Chr.</i> 600. (if truly copied) agreeing (possibly
    well enough) with the time of her death? Besides, <i>Leyland</i>
    affirms,<span class="sni"><i>Leyl. de assert. Arth.</i></span> severall Writers make mention, she took <i>upon her a Nuns
    veil at</i> Ambresbury, <i>died, and was buried there</i>. To which
    he gives so much credit, that (whatever <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>
    delivers to the contrary) he will by no means allow, either her body
    to be afterwards translated from <i>Ambresbury</i>, or, at any time,
    buried by her husband King <i>Arthur</i> at <i>Glastonbury</i>. Unto
    <i>Leylands</i> reasons for her interment at <i>Ambresbury</i>,
    <i>Camden</i> (it seems) inclines also, because wholly silent of
    her Sepulchre, discovered any where else: though he at large sets
    down all the circumstances of her Husbands body, its being found at
    <i>Glastenbury</i>. For, had <i>Camden</i> apprehended any thing
    inducing him to beleeve,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> her body had been together with his there
    found, he would never, certainly, have concealed it from posterity.</p>

  <p>Whether the aforesaid Tomb so found, were her monument, yea or no,
    enough concerning the slaughter and sepultures of the afore mentioned
    <i>Britans</i>; as also, that <i>Stoneheng</i> was not erected in
    memory of them. Let us come now to <i>Aurelius Ambrosius</i>, and see
    whether <i>Polydore Virgill’s</i> story in relation to <i>Stoneheng</i>
    agrees with what other Authors have delivered of <i>Aurelius</i>.
    For from <i>Polydore’s</i> authority, our modern Writers raise their
    second, and quite contrary opinion:<span class="sni"><i>Speed lib. 7.<br />Stow fo. 53.</i></span> namely, that the <i>Britans</i>
    erected this <i>Antiquity</i> for <i>A. Ambrosius</i> his Sepulchre.</p>

  <p><i>Polydore Virgill</i><span class="sni"><i>Polyd. Virg. lib. 3.</i></span> treating of the actions of those times betwixt
    the <i>Britans</i> and <i>Saxons</i>; Britanni, <i>Duci suo</i>
    Ambrosio <i>de republica bene merito magnificum</i> (saith he)
    <i>posuerunt sepulchrum</i> &amp;c. <i>The</i> Britans <i>in memory of
    his great atchievements for the Commonwealth, erected a magnificent
    Sepulchre to their Chieftain</i> Ambrosius, <i>made of great square
    stones in form of a Crown, even in that place, where fighting, he was
    slain, that the prowesse of so great a Commander, should neither be
    forgotten amongst themselves, who then lived, or left unremembred to
    posterity. Which Monument remains even to this day, in the Diocese
    of</i> Salisbury, <i>near unto the village called</i> Amisbery.</p>

  <p>This opinion of <i>Polydore</i> is grounded (as I conceive) upon
    no great likelihood. For, should the <i>British Nobles</i>, far
    inferiour to <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, in honour, and dignity, be
    buried in the Churchyard of a Monastery, and a Sepulchre assigned
    for <i>Ambrosius</i> himself in the open fields? Should that
    <i>Christian</i> King, who had accomplished so many great atchievements
    victoriously against the <i>Pagans</i>, enemies to <i>Christ</i>?
    Caused Churches to be repaired, which the Barbarism of the
    <i>Saxons</i> had destroyed? pulled down and demolished idolatrous
    places of the <i>Heathen</i>, and (as is more probable) rather, then
    erected by him, whilst living, to others, or by others, to his memory
    after dead, the very first that began to deface this Heathenish sacred
    structure (for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> though a <i>Roman</i>, yet a <i>Christian</i>, and
    zeal to true Religion might, no doubt, cause him dispense with ruining
    idolatrous <i>Temples</i> though formerly built, and consecrated to
    false Gods by his seduced Auncestors) should he, I say, be buried
    Pagan-like, in unsanctified, unhallowed ground, and others far lesse
    eminent, lesse conspicuous, in more noble, and sacred places? It could
    never be. Neither reason of State, nor fervor of piety, in those more
    scrupulous times, could ever admit thereof.</p>

  <div class="sni"><i>Leyl. de assert. Art.</i></div>

  <p>Had <i>Polydore</i>, or any other, told us some Pagan-Saxon-Commander
    lay there intombed, ’twould have carried a shew of much more credit,
    and the ancient custome of that <i>Peoples</i> burying their dead might
    have been produced, at least as a probable argument, to confirm the
    same. For the Saxons a Pagan Nation, if any of <i>their Princes or
    Nobility died, in their houses at home of sicknesse, were buried in
    pleasant, and delightfull gardens; if from home, and in the wars, not
    far from their camps, in heaps of earth cast up in the fields, which
    heaps they called Burrows: and the promiscuous common people in medows
    and open fields</i>. Saxones <i>Nobiles gens Christi ignara, in hortis
    amœnis, si domi forte ægroti moriebantur: si foris &amp; bello occisi,
    in egestis per campos terræ tumulis quos Burgos appellabant, juxta
    castra sepulti sunt: vulgus autem promiscuum etiam in pratis &amp; apertis
    campis.</i> As <i>Leyland</i>, who laid a good ground-work towards the
    discovery of <i>British Antiquities</i>, delivers.</p>

  <p><i>Polydore</i> neverthelesse, had great reason to imagine <i>A.
    Ambrosius</i> famed the restorer of his Countrey (and Bulwark of War,
    as <i>Camden</i> cals him) worthy an everlasting Monument, <i>Extat
    etiam nunc id monimentum in diœcesi</i> Sarisberiensi <i>prope pagum
    quam</i> Amisberiam <i>vocant, Which monument is yet extant in the
    diœcese of</i> Salisbury (saith he) <i>not far from</i> Ambresbury
    <i>Town</i>: and so was the Churchyard of the Monastery too. He also
    tels us, <i>Factum fuisse ad formam coronæ, it was made in form of a
    Crown</i>. An elegant expression (I confesse) of a no lesse elegant
    work, if he meant <i>Stoneheng</i>; yet no argument thereby to prove
    <i>A. Ambrosius</i> or buried, or slain there. For, as touching
    <i>A. Ambrosius</i> his death, severall Authors, of as good cre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>dit
    as <i>Polydore</i> (his integrity neverthelesse I question not,
    others have been busie enough therein) affirm,<span class="sni"><i>G. Monm.<br />M. Westm.<br />Polychron.<br />Caxton.<br />Leyland.</i></span> that <i>Pascentius
    Vortigerns</i> son, with many rewards corrupted a certain <i>Saxon</i>
    called <i>Eopas</i> (<i>Clappa</i>, saith <i>Caxton</i>) who, taking
    upon him the habit of a Monk, under pretence of Physick (<i>A.
    Ambrosius</i> being then sick) gave him poyson, whereof he died at
    <i>Winchester</i>. And no wonder he was so poysoned, many examples
    of the like kinde being recorded in History. As in later times,<span class="sni"><i>Knolls in vit. Ba.</i></span> the
    <i>Turkish</i> Emperour <i>Bajazet</i> the second, under pretence
    of Physick poysoned by a Jew: also <i>Conrad</i> third of that name<span class="sni"><i>Ped. Mexia in vit. Con.</i></span>
    Emperour of <i>Germany</i>, by an <i>Italian</i>: and, in times of old,
    under the same pretence, <i>Pyrrhus</i> that famous Epirot<span class="sni"><i>Plutarch in vit. Pyrr.</i></span> had been
    poysoned by his own Physitian, if <i>C. Fabricius</i> the Roman Consul
    would have enclined to such ignoble resolutions, as <i>Pascentius</i>
    after put in act against <i>A. Ambrosius</i> in our story.</p>

  <p>Amongst other, who relate this disaster of <i>A. Ambrosius</i>,
    <i>Matthew Westminster</i><span class="sni"><i>Ma. West. fo. 94.</i></span> tels us, The said pretended Monk, <i>tandem
    ad Regis præsentiam perductum, venenum ei porrexisse, &amp;c. being at last
    admitted to the Kings presence, administered poyson unto him, which
    having drunk, the wicked Traytor advised him to sleep, and in so doing
    suddenly should recover health! Nec mora, illabente per poros corporis
    &amp; venas veneno, mortem pariter subsecutam esse. But, ere long, the
    poyson being dispersed through the pores and veins of his body, death
    seizes upon him.</i></p>

  <p>Concerning the buriall of <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, if give credit to
    <i>Geffrey Monmouths</i> affirming <i>A. Ambrosius</i> on his death-bed
    gave command, and was accordingly buried, in the Sepulchre by him
    (whilst living) prepared in the Churchyard adjoyning to the Monastery
    at <i>Ambresbury</i>, then was <i>A. Ambrosius</i> nor <i>buried</i>
    at <i>Stoneheng</i>, nor consequently this <i>Antiquity</i> erected to
    his memory. <i>Geffrey Monmouth</i> tels us; <i>His death being known,
    the Bishops, Abbats, and all the Clergy of that province, assembled
    together in the City of</i> Winchester.<span class="sni"><i>G. Monm. lib. 8.</i></span> <i>Et quia vivens adhuc
    præceperat, ut in cœmeterio prope cœnobium</i> Ambrii, <i>quod ipse
    paraverat sepeliretur, tulerunt corpus ejus, eodem atque cum regalibus
    exequiis, humaverunt. And with respect to his command,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> whilest living,
    that in the Churchyard adjoyning to the Monastery at</i> Ambresbury,
    <i>prepared by him, he would be buried, they took his body and with
    royall solemnities enterred him there</i>.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, at <i>Ambresbury</i>, that is, <i>Ambrose</i> his Town,
    (<i>Camden</i> tels us)<span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo. 254.</i></span> <i>certain ancient Kings, by report of the</i>
    British <i>story, lay interred</i>. Whether <i>A. Ambrosius</i>
    was one of them, or no, I argue not; yet the same Author saith,
    <i>Ambrose Aurelianus</i> gave name unto the place. And why not, he
    being buried there, as well, as upon the translation of the body of
    <i>Edmund</i> that most Christian King, the Town of <i>Edmundsbury</i>
    in <i>Suffolk</i> was so called?</p>

  <p>It manifestly hence appears, <i>Stoneheng</i> no Sepulchre, either
    erected by <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, or by the <i>British</i> Nobility, or
    to any of their memories. Some Monument there was, perhaps, anciently
    set up in honour of them, at the Monastery of <i>Ambresbury</i>.
    Which, the fury of the <i>Saxons</i> when victorious, or violence of
    time, which destroyeth all things, utterly consuming, might happily
    be the reason, Historians in succeeding Ages, finding so notable an
    <i>Antiquity</i> as <i>Stoneheng</i>, not far from thence, and not
    apprehending for what use it was first built, suppos’d no other thing
    worthy <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, or those <i>Britans</i>, then such an
    extraordinary structure. Whereas, the Monuments in those ancient times,
    made for great Princes here in <i>Britain</i>, were onely two Pyramids
    between which interred, of no extraordinary bignesse erected to their
    memory in whate’re Religious places those Princes lay buried. Moreover,
    if seriously take notice of the severall sorts of Sepulchres used by
    divers Nations, none are found bearing like <i>Aspect</i> with this
    work <i>Stoneheng</i>, but of other kinde of <i>Architecture</i>, far
    different in <i>Form</i>, <i>Manner</i>, and <i>Composure</i>. Some,
    made of one Columne onely; or, if otherwise, only a vase erected on
    the place of buriall, as amongst the <i>Athenians</i>: Some, had a
    Columne whereon the shields used in War by the deceased, whilst living,
    were fixt, as in those medals of silver, which the <i>Roman</i> Senate
    dedicated to <i>Vespasian</i>: Some, a Columne with a Statue thereon;
    so the famous Columne of <i>Trajan</i> had a <i>Colossus</i> on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
    top thereof, as by his medals also appears. Again, the <i>Gauls</i> on
    the tops of Mountains, erected <i>Pyramid’s</i> or <i>Columnes</i>,
    as Monuments to their Princes. The <i>Saxons</i> were buried (as said
    before) in huge heaps of earth, to this day visible among us. The
    <i>Keep</i> of the now <i>Castell</i> S. <i>Angelo</i> at <i>Rome</i>
    was the Sepulchre of the Emperour <i>Adrian</i>. (such mighty moles
    were the Monuments of the <i>Romans</i>) The <i>Greeks</i> erected
    <i>Altars</i>, and instituted Sacrifices to the memory of their
    <i>Chieftains</i>, as the <i>Spartans</i> to <i>Lysander</i>: The
    renowned <i>Carian</i> Queen made the <i>Mausoleum</i> for her husband,
    a massie bulk of building, 140 foot high: The huge <i>Pyramid’s</i>
    in <i>Ægypt</i> causing such wonder in the world, were Sepulchres of
    <i>Ægyptian</i> Kings. In a word, amongst all Nations, Sepulchres
    whether little or great, were always reall and solid piles; not airous,
    with frequent openings, and void spaces of ground within, exposed to
    Sun and wind, neither uncovered like this <i>Antiquity</i>; or in any
    manner so built, as may enforce the least presumption, that this our
    <i>Stoneheng</i> was ever a Sepulchre.</p>

  <p>I have given you a full relation what concerning <i>Stoneheng</i> hath
    been delivered by Writers, in respect of us though ancient, yet in
    regard of the great antiquity of this <i>Work</i>, indeed but modern,
    <i>Geffrey Monmouth</i> living not full five hundred years ago, and
    <i>Polydore Virgill</i> long after him, in King <i>Henry</i> the
    eighths reign: Who, as they are the principall Authors that write any
    thing of <i>Stoneheng</i>; so, upon what authority deliver the same,
    they make not appear. Insomuch, <i>Camden</i> gives no more credit to
    their relations in this very particular, then unto common sayings,
    (so he cals them) as if grounded upon <i>Fame</i> only, or invented
    by themselves. And it may the rather be so presumed, because, as they
    lived not in ancient times, and consequently could not themselves
    bear testimony of any such things; so, neither the <i>Britans</i> nor
    <i>Saxons</i> for a long time after their first arrivall here, had any
    Records or Writings to convey whatever actions, either of their own, or
    others to posterity. <i>Ninnius</i> a <i>British</i> Historian, living
    about one thousand years ago, telling us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> Britannos <i>doctores nullam
    peritiam habuisse, &amp;c. The great Masters and Doctors of</i> Britain
    <i>had no skill, nor left memoriall of any thing in writing</i>:
    confessing, that himself <i>gathered whatsoever he wrote, out of the
    Annals and Chronicles of the holy Fathers. Nec</i> Saxones <i>amusi
    quicquam penè de rebus inter ipsos, &amp;</i> Britannos <i>eo tempore
    gestis scriptum posteritati reliquerint</i>, &amp;c. <i>Neither did the</i>
    Saxons <i>being unlearned</i> (saith <i>Leyland</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Leyland. de assert. Art. fol. 25.</i></span> <i>leave almost
    any thing in writing to posterity, of the actions performed in those
    times betwixt themselves and</i> Britans: <i>whatsoever, remembred
    after Christ taught in this Island, of the first victories of the</i>
    Saxons, <i>being both taken up upon trust from the mouth of the common
    people, and committed to writing from vulgar reports only. Neither
    the</i> Britans, <i>utterly worn out with so many wars, had</i> (as the
    same Author hath it) <i>or desire, or opportunity, had they desired it,
    to bestow their pains in compiling any whatever history, that might
    commend their actions to succeeding Ages.</i></p>

  <p>But, it maybe objected: If <i>Polydore Virgill</i>, and <i>Geffrey
    Monmouth</i> could neither be eye-witnesses themselves, nor have
    authority from other more ancient Authors for what related by them
    concerning <i>Stoneheng</i>: and that from whatever writings ancient
    or modern, not any thing of certainty can be found out concerning
    the same; from whence then appear, for what use, or by whom
    <i>Stoneheng</i> erected? I answer, though not appear from Histories
    written either by the <i>Britans</i> or <i>Saxons</i>; yet, as
    <i>Gildas</i> professing he wrote his History (for the former reasons)
    <i>by relations from beyond Sea</i>: and, as <i>Ninnius</i> his <i>out
    of the Annals and Chronicles of the holy Fathers</i> as aforesaid: so,
    severall other ways a possibility of truth may be gathered, namely,
    from the authority of other Nations; from the concurrence of time for
    such undertakings; from the customs of forepassed Ages in like works;
    from the manner and form of building proper to severall Countries; from
    the use to which such buildings applied, and the like. Upon which, as
    occasion serves, intending hereafter more largely to insist, I shall
    in the mean while set down the judgement our late Writers give of this
    <i>Antiquity</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

  <p><i>Camden</i>, a diligent searcher after Antiquities of our Nation,
    having, in his <i>Chorography</i> of <i>Wiltshire</i>, collected
    all the aforesaid opinions, together with his own, gives a summary
    description of <i>Stoneheng</i>, in words as follow. <span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo. 251.</i></span> <i>Towards
    the North, about six miles from</i> Salisbury, <i>in the plain, is
    to be seen a huge and monstrous peece of work, such as</i> Cicero
    <i>termeth</i> insanam substructionem. <i>For, within the circuit
    of a ditch, there are erected in manner of a Crown, in three ranks
    or courses one within another, certain mighty and unwrought stones,
    whereof some are twenty eight foot high, &amp; seven foot broad, upon
    the heads of which others, like overthwart peeces, do bear and rest
    cross-wise, with a small tenon and mortaise, so as the whole frame
    seemeth to hang; whereof we call it</i> Stoneheng, <i>like as our old
    Historians termed it for the greatness the Giants dance. Our Countrimen
    reckon this for one of our wonders, and miracles. And much they
    marvell, from whence such huge stones were brought, considering that in
    all those quarters bordering thereupon, there is hardly to be found any
    common stone at all for building: as also, by what means they were set
    up. For mine own part about these points I am not curiously to argue
    and dispute, but rather to lament with much grief, that the Authors
    of so notable a Monument are thus buried in oblivion. Yet some there
    are, that think them to be no naturall stones hewn out of the rock,
    but artificially made of pure sand, and by some glewy and unctuous
    matter knit and incorporate together, like as those ancient trophies or
    monuments of victory which I have seen in</i> Yorkshire. <i>And what
    marvell? Read we not I pray you in</i> Pliny, <i>that the sand or dust
    of</i> Puteoli, <i>being covered over with water, becometh forthwith a
    very stone, that the cisterns in</i> Rome <i>of sand, digged out of the
    ground, and the strongest kind of lime wrought together grow so hard,
    that they seem stones indeed? and that statues and images of marble
    scalings, and small grit grow together so compact and firm, that they
    were deemed entire and solid marble? The common saying is, that</i>
    Ambrosius Aurelianus, <i>or his brother</i> Uther <i>did rear them up,
    by the art of</i> Merlin, <i>&amp;c.</i> Thus far <i>Camden</i>, it being
    needlesse to repeat more from him, having already delivered the story
    from the Authors themselves. Yet here neverthelesse, as necessarily
    induced thereunto, I shall take leave to observe something more
    remarkable to our purpose in hand, upon his words.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

  <p>In the first place then, <i>Stoneheng</i> is by him called <i>a
    huge and monstrous peece of work</i>, terming it from <i>Cicero,
    insanam substructionem</i>. To which I say, had <i>Camden</i> as well
    attained other abilities of an <i>Architect</i>, as he was skilfull
    in <i>Antiquities</i>: or been as conversant in <i>Antiquities</i>
    abroad, as learned in those of his own Nation, he would have given a
    far different judgement hereof. For, whosoever is acquainted with the
    ancient ruines yet remaining in and about <i>Italy</i>, may easily
    perceive this no such huge building, either for the circuit of the
    work, or bignesse of the stones, they being as manageable to the
    <i>Roman Architects</i>, as amongst us to raise a May-pole, or mast
    of a Ship. And, if this styled <i>huge</i> and <i>monstrous</i>, what
    may be said of <i>Diocletians</i> baths? the great <i>Cirque</i>?
    <i>Marcellus</i> his Theater? <i>Vespasians Temple of Peace</i>? and
    other prodigious works of the <i>Romans</i>? the very remainders
    whereof now lying in the dust, breed amazement and wonder (not without
    just reason too) in whosoever beholds them with attentivenesse and
    judgement. Nay, whereas he styles it <i>insanam substructionem</i>,
    it’s demonstrable, that betwixt this Island of great <i>Britain</i>,
    and <i>Rome</i> it self, there’s no one structure to be seen, wherein
    more clearly shines those harmoniacall proportions, of which only the
    best times could vaunt, then in this of <i>Stoneheng</i>.</p>

  <p>Moreover, <i>Our Countreymen marvell</i> (saith he) <i>from whence
    such huge stones were brought, considering that in all those quarters
    bordering thereupon, there is hardly to be found any common stone
    for building</i>. Upon what trust <i>Camden</i> (his extraordinary
    judgement otherwise considered) took this relation, I know not. For
    there is not onely common stone thereabouts, for ordinary uses, but
    stone of extraordinary proportions likewise, even for greater works (if
    occasion were) then <i>Stoneheng</i>: the Quarries of <i>Hasselborough</i>
    and <i>Chilmark</i>, both of them not far from the borders of the plain,
    having of a long time furnished all the adjacent parts with common
    stone for building. And (to come nearer the matter) it is manifest,
    that in divers places about the Plain, the same kinde of Stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
    whereof this <i>Antiquity</i> consists may be found, especially about
    <i>Aibury</i> in North-<i>Wiltshire</i>, not many miles distant from
    it, where not onely are Quarries of the like stone, but also stones of
    far greater dimensions then any at <i>Stoneheng</i>, may be had.</p>

  <p><i>They wonder also</i> (saith he) <i>by what means they</i> (that,
    is such huge stones) <i>were set up</i>. What may be effected by that
    <i>Mechanicall Art</i>, which <i>Dee</i> in his <i>Mathematicall
    Preface</i> to <i>Euclyde</i>, cals <i>Menadry</i>, or <i>Art of
    ordering Engines for raising weights</i>; those (it seems) of whom
    <i>Camden</i> speaks took little notice of, when <i>Archimedes</i>
    during the siege of <i>Syracuse</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Plut. in Marcel.</i></span> raised out of the Sea, and turned
    in the air at pleasure, the Ships and Gallies of the <i>Romans</i>,
    full fraught as they were with Souldiers, Mariners, and their ordinary
    lading: and if King <i>Hieron</i> could have assigned him, a fit place
    to firm his engines on, he would have undertaken to remove, even the
    terrestriall <i>Globe</i> out of the worlds <i>center</i>, so high,
    perfection in this <i>Art</i> transported him. What should I say of
    the <i>Obelisk</i> in Ages so far past, brought from the Mountains of
    <i>Armenia</i>, and erected in <i>Babylon</i> by <i>Semiramis</i>, one
    hundred &amp; fifty foot high, and at the base twenty four foot square of
    one entire stone? <i>Est in fano</i> Latonæ (saith <i>Herodotus</i><span class="sni"><i>Herod. lib. 2.</i></span> of
    his own knowledge) <i>delubrum ex uno factum lapide, cujus parietes
    æquali celsitudine ad longitudinem quadragenum cubitorum, cujus
    lacunari, pro tecto impositus est alius lapis quatuor cubitorum per
    oras crassitudine. In the Temple of</i> Latona (in <i>Ægypt</i>)
    <i>is a Chappell formed of one stone, whose walls being of equall
    height, are in length forty cubits, covered in like manner with one
    sole stone four cubits thick</i>. Those, which made this wonder would
    have much more admired, if they could have seen the <i>Obelisk</i>
    raised in times of old by King <i>Ramesis</i> at <i>Heliopolis</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Ptol. lib. 4.<br />Plin. lib. 36.</i></span>
    in that part of <i>Ægypt</i> anciently called <i>Thebais</i>, in
    height one hundred twenty one Geometrical feet (which of our measure
    makes one hundred thirty six feet) of one entire stone: and so little
    wonder made they of raising it, that the Architect undertook and did
    effect it, the Kings own son being at the same time bound to the top
    thereof. Amongst the <i>Ro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>mans</i>, <i>Augustus Cæsar</i> erected in
    the great Cirque at <i>Rome</i>, an <i>Obelisk</i> of one stone, one
    hundred and twenty foot, nine inches long: another also, was set up
    in <i>Mars</i> field, nine foot higher then it, by the said Emperour.
    And it seems also, neither they, nor <i>Camdens</i> self had ever seen
    that <i>Obelisk</i>, which even in these our days, in the year one
    thousand five hundred eighty six, <i>Sixtus Quintus</i> caused to be
    erected in the <i>Piazza</i> of S. <i>Peter</i> at <i>Rome</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Dom. Font. lib. 1.</i></span> one
    hundred and eight <i>Roman</i> palms high, and at the base twelve palms
    square, (according to our Assise, fourscore and one foot high, and
    nine foot square) of one entire stone also: <i>Dominico Fontana</i>
    being <i>Architect</i>. But, there are more strange things (as Sir
    <i>Walter Raleigh</i> hath it) in the world, then betwixt <i>London</i>
    and <i>Stanes</i>. It is want of knowledge in <i>Arts</i> makes such
    admirers, and <i>Art</i> it self have so many Enemies. Had I not
    been thought worthy (by him who then commanded) to have been sole
    <i>Architect</i> thereof, I would have made some mention of the great
    stones used in the work, and <i>Portico</i> at the West end of S.
    <i>Pauls</i> Church <i>London</i>, but I forbear; though in greatnesse
    they were equall to most in this <i>Antiquity</i>, and raised to
    a far greater height then any there. What manner of Engines the
    <i>Ancients</i> used for raising; and what secure ways they had, for
    cariage and transportation of their huge weights, is more proper for
    another subject.</p>

  <p><i>Some there are</i> (saith <i>Camden</i>) <i>that think them to be
    no naturall stones, hewn out of the rock, but artificially made of
    pure sand, and by some glewy and unctuous matter, knit and incorporate
    together, like those ancient trophies, or monuments of victory, which
    I have seen in</i> Yorkshire. As for these Monuments (for my part)
    I have not seen, otherwise I would give my sense upon them, and
    happily they may be found as far from being artificiall, as those at
    <i>Stoneheng</i>. <i>And what marvell?</i> (saith he) <i>read we not,
    I pray you, in</i> Pliny, <i>that the sand or dust of</i> Puteoli,
    <i>being covered over with water, becometh forthwith a very stone
    &amp;c.</i> He might as well have told us the Rocks in <i>Portland</i>
    are artificiall. But it’s true, this sand of <i>Puteoli</i>, was much
    used by the <i>Ancients</i>, and it is such a kind of earth, as is
    very famous for its admirable ef<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>fects in building, being tempered
    with the cement of <i>Cuma</i>: For, it not onely yeelds strength
    to all other buildings, but thereby also, all works made in the Sea
    under water, are most firmly consolidated. Yet, doe I not find,
    that ever the <i>Ancients</i> made any artificiall stones thereof,
    or that <i>Vitruvius</i> hath any thing to that purpose, to him the
    credit given to <i>Pliny</i>, and others, concerning the Earth of
    <i>Puteoli</i>, being only due; posterity being in the first place
    beholding unto him for finding out the nature of that earth, he giving
    us not only the effects thereof, but the cause also from whence those
    effects proceed. <i>Hoc autem fieri hac ratione videtur, quòd sub his
    montibus</i> (i.e. <i>in regionibus</i> Baianis,<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 2. cap. 6.</i></span> <i>&amp; in agris, quæ
    sunt circa</i> Vesuvium <i>montem) &amp; terræ ferventes sunt, &amp; fontes
    crebri, qui non essent, si non in imo haberent, aut de sulphure, aut
    alumine, aut bitumine ardentes maximos ignes. Which is</i> (saith
    he) <i>by reason in those mountains</i> (to wit, <i>in the regions
    of</i> Baiæ, <i>and fields about mount</i> Vesuvius) <i>the grounds are
    hot, and full of springs, which heat could not be, but that from the
    bottome, are nourished mighty great fires, arising from sulphur, alume,
    or brimstone there.</i> Indeed, according to <i>Pliny</i>, the sand
    upon the side of the hill of <i>Puteoli</i>, being opposed to the Sea,
    and continually drenched, and drowned with the water thereof, doth (by
    the restringent quality, no doubt, of the salt water) become a stone
    so compact, and united together, that scorning all the violence of the
    surging billows, it hardeneth every day more and more.</p>

  <p>Neverthelesse, whosoever could find out any kind of earth in this
    Island, naturally apt, to make artificiall stones of such greatnesse
    as these; and, like them so obdurate also, that hardly any tool enter
    them: or, that our Auncestors in times of old, did make use of such
    a cement, and in what manner composed by them. The benefit thereof
    doubtlesse, would amount so ample to this Nation, that Records could
    not but render him deservedly famous to all posterity. In the mean
    while, as it is most certain those stones at <i>Stoneheng</i> are
    naturall; so, am I as clearly of opinion, the very Quarries from whence
    hewn, were about <i>Ai<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>bury</i> beforementioned: where, no small
    quantities of the same kind, are even at this day to be had; vast
    scantlings, not only appearing about the Town it self, but throughout
    the plain and fields adjoyning, the Quarries lying bare, numbers also
    numberlesse of stones, are generally seen. (being no small prejudice
    to the bordering inhabitants) As also, not far from the edge of
    <i>Wiltshire</i>, in the ascent from <i>Lamborn</i> to <i>Whitehorse
    hill</i>, the like stones are daily discovered. To mention, more places
    in particular is needlesse, the Quarries at and about <i>Aibury</i>
    (without relating to <i>Lamborn</i>, or what ever other) distant but
    fifteen miles or thereabouts from <i>Stoneheng</i>, being of themselves
    sufficient to clear the doubt. These, having through long time, got
    the very same crustation upon them, are in like manner coloured,
    grained, bedded, weighty, and of like difficulty in working, as those
    at <i>Stoneheng</i>. Some of which, being of a whitish colour, are
    intermixt and veined here and there with red: some, of a lightish
    blew, glister, as if minerall amongst them: some, for the most part
    white, perplexed (as it were) with a ruddy colour: some, dark gray and
    russet, differing in kinds as those stones at <i>Aibury</i> do. Some
    of them again, of a grayish colour, are speckled or intermixt with
    dark green, and white, together with yellow amongst it, resembling
    after a sort, that kind of marble which the <i>Italians</i> (from the
    valley where the Quarries are found) call <i>Pozzevera</i>; nothing,
    notwithstanding, so beautifull, though naturally much harder, and
    being weathered by time, as in this work; disdain the touch even of
    the best tempered tool. Insomuch, that if nothing else, the more then
    ordinary hardnesse of them is such, as will in part convince any
    indifferent judgement in the nature and quality of stones; those, in
    this <i>Antiquity</i>, are not (as <i>Camden</i> would have them)
    artificiall, but naturall.</p>

  <p>Whatsoever, worthy admiration concerning <i>Stoneheng</i>, either in
    relation to the greatnesse of the work in generall, the extraordinary
    proportion of the stones in particular, the wonder the people make,
    from whence brought, by what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> Arts or Engines raised, and in such
    order placed, <i>Camden</i> delivers; certainly, in his judgement he
    was wholly opposite to the opinions of the aforesaid <i>British</i>
    Historians. He would never else, with so much regret have complained,
    <i>The Authors of so notable a Monument lay buried in oblivion</i>, had
    he given any the least credit, this <i>Antiquity</i> had been built,
    either by <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, or the <i>British</i> Nobility, or to
    eternize either of their names, or actions to succeeding generations.
    Let <i>Geffrey Monmouth</i> and his followers, say what they please,
    <i>Henry Huntingdon</i> (his Contemporary, if not more Ancient) is

    <i>erected, or</i> (which is fully answered already) <i>by what Art

    also <i>Draytons</i> judgement in his <i>Poly-olbion</i> couched
    under the fiction of old <i>Wansdikes</i> depraving <i>Stoneheng</i>.
    (<i>Wansdike</i> being a huge Ditch in <i>Wiltshire</i> so called,

  <p class="noindent">For, as for that ridiculous Fable, of <i>Merlins</i>
    transporting the stones out of <i>Ireland</i> by Magick, it’s an idle
    conceit. As also, that old wives tale, that for the greatnesse it was
    in elder times called the <i>Giants dance</i>. The name of the <i>dance
    of Giants</i> by which it is styled in <i>Monmouth</i>, hath nothing
    allusive, no not so much as to the <i>tale he tels us</i>, saith a
    modern Writer in the life of <i>Nero Cæsar</i>.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, our modern Historians <i>Stow</i> and <i>Speed</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Speed lib. 7.<br />Stow fo. 58. in 4<sup>o</sup>.</i></span> tell
    us, in severall parts of the Plain adjoyning, have been by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> digging
    found, peeces of ancient fashioned armour, and the bones of men,
    insinuating this as an argument, for upholding the opinions of the
    <i>British</i> Writers. To which, if they would have those to be the
    bones of the slaughtered <i>Britans</i>, how came those Armours to
    be found with them, they coming to the Treaty unarmed, and without
    weapons? Howsoever, what is done in the Plains abroad, concerns not
    <i>Stoneheng</i>, Neither can any man think it strange, that in a
    place, where <i>Fame</i> hath rendred, so many memorable and fierce
    battels, fought in times of old, rusty armour, and mens bones should be
    digged up. It is usuall throughout the world in all such places, and
    (if I mistake not) <i>Sands</i> in his Travels, relates, that even in
    the Plains of <i>Pharsalia</i>, such like bones and Armour, have lately
    been discovered: and Sir <i>Henry Blunt</i> in that notable relation of
    his voyage into the <i>Levant</i>, speaks with much judgement of those
    <i>Pharsalian</i> fields. Likewise, the aforesaid Writers,<span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo. 194.</i> <i>Speed lib. 7.</i></span> might well
    have remembred, some of themselves deliver, that at <i>Kambulan</i>,
    or <i>Cambula</i> in <i>Cornwall</i>, such habiliments of War have
    been digged up, in tillage of the ground, witnessing either the fatall
    field, sometimes there fought, where <i>Mordred</i> was slain by
    <i>Arthur</i>, and <i>Arthur</i> himself received his deaths wound:
    or else, the reliques of that battel betwixt the <i>Britans</i> and
    <i>Saxons</i>, in the year eight hundred and twenty. ’Tis true, the
    relation conduces much towards confirming, that ancient custome of the
    <i>Saxons</i>, formerly recited out of <i>Leyland</i>, considering
    especially, not far from this <i>Antiquity</i>, lie certain hillocks,
    at this day commonly called the <i>seven Burrows</i>, where it may be
    presumed, some <i>Princes</i>, or <i>Nobles</i> of the <i>Saxon</i>
    Nation lie interred. But, that <i>Stoneheng</i> should therefore be
    a place of buriall, the aforesaid relation to maintain the same is
    nothing worth.</p>

  <p>They adde moreover, the stones yet remaining are not to be numbred,
    according as our Noble <i>Sydney</i> in his Sonnet of the wonders of
    <i>England</i>.</p>

  <p>This, though it scarcely merits an answer, yet, to satisfie those
    which in this point may be curious, let them but observe the orders
    of the Circles, as they now appear, and not passe from one to another
    confusedly (noting neverthelesse where they begin) and they’ll find the
    just number easie to be taken.</p>

  <p>Now, though whether in order to the Place it self where this
    <i>Antiquity</i> stands, or <i>Persons</i>, by whom <i>Stoneheng</i>
    pretended to be built, enough laid, to wave the reports upon fancy,
    or common Fame, formerly delivered: to the state of <i>Time</i>
    neverthelesse, wherein the <i>British</i> Histories would have it
    erected, because nothing by me hath yet been spoken, I will therefore
    adde, ’tis not probable such a work as <i>Stoneheng</i> could be then
    built. For, although our <i>Britans</i>, in ancient time possessed,
    together with the <i>Roman</i> civility, all good <i>Arts</i>, it
    is evident during the reign of <i>A. Ambrosius</i> (about the first
    coming in of the <i>Saxons</i> here, and towards the later end of
    the fifth Century, as Historians and Chronologists compute it) in
    the last declining of the <i>Roman</i> Empire, the <i>Arts</i> of
    <i>Design</i>, of which <i>Architecture</i> chief, were utterly lost
    even in <i>Rome</i> it self, much more in <i>Britain</i>, being
    then but a Tempest-beaten <i>Province</i>, and utterly abandoned by
    the <i>Romans</i>. <i>Britain</i>, therefore, being over-run with
    enemies, and the knowledge of <i>Arts</i> then lost amongst them:
    none, questionlesse, can reasonably apprehend so notable a work as
    <i>Stoneheng</i> could in such times be built.</p>

  <p>That, amongst the <i>Romans</i> and <i>Britans</i> both, <i>A.
    Ambrosius</i> governing here, all Sciences were utterly perished,
    is evidently manifest. For, the <i>Goths</i> had then invaded
    <i>Italy</i>; and that vast Empire drooping with extreme Age, by the
    fatall irruption of strange Nations, was not only torn in peeces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
    but <i>Barbarisme</i> having trod learning under foot, and the sword
    bearing more sway then letters, or learned men, all Sciences were
    neglected; and particularly that of <i>Building</i> fell into such
    decay, that till of late about the year one thousand five hundred and
    ten, it lay swallowed up, and (as I may so say) buried in oblivion.
    When one <i>Bramante</i> of the Dutchy of <i>Urbin</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Serl. lib. 3.</i></span> attaining
    admirable perfection in <i>Architecture</i>, restored to the world
    again, the true rules of building, according to those Orders, by
    the ancient <i>Romans</i> in their most flourishing times observed.
    Furthermore, not onely liberall Sciences and <i>Architecture</i>, but
    <i>Art</i> military also, about the time of <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, was so
    far lost amongst the <i>Romans</i>, that they were ignorant, yea, in
    the very rudiments of War. Insomuch, (as <i>Procopius</i> in his second
    Book of the <i>Gothick</i> Wars relate) <i>Barbarism</i> had bereft
    them of the skill, even in what manner to sound a retreat.</p>

  <p>With us here also, the <i>Saxons</i> domineer’d over all, and <i>A.
    Ambrosius</i> with the <i>Britans</i> had enough to do, in endeavouring
    the recovery of their lost Countrey from a mighty prevailing Enemy,
    that in few years afterwards (maugre all the ways which force or policy
    could invent) conquered the whole Nation. Among other calamities
    attending that miserable Age, <i>Camden</i> (from <i>William</i> of
    <i>Malmsbury</i>) directly to the purpose in hand tels us.<span class="sni"><i>W. Malmes. fol. 8.</i><br /><i>Camden fo. 87.</i></span> <i>Cum
    Tyranni nullum in agris præter semibarbaros, nullum in urbibus præter
    ventri deditos reliquissent</i>: Britannia <i>omni patrocinio juvenilis
    vigoris viduata, omni Artium exercitio exinanita, conterminarum
    gentium inhiationi diu obnoxia fuit. When the Tyrants</i> (to wit, the
    <i>Romans</i>) <i>had left none in the Countrey but half Barbarians,
    none in the Cities and Towns, but such as wholly gave themselves to
    belly-cheer</i>; Britain, <i>destitute of all protection, by her
    vigorous young men, bereaved of</i> all exercise, and practice of good
    Arts, <i>became exposed for a long time to the greedy, and gaping jaws
    of Nations confining upon her</i>.</p>

  <p>Here you have it from an Author, more ancient then <i>G. Monmouth</i>
    a little, though both lived in one age, the times about <i>A.
    Ambrosius</i> government, whether before, during his reign, or after,
    were so full of miseries, that he complains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> none then employed,
    or exercised in any whatever works belonging to <i>Art</i>. They
    had somthing else (as appears by divers Writers) to think upon, all
    their abilities being insufficient to defend their Countrey from
    forein servitude, their Cities and Towns from ruine, and destruction,
    and their habitations from rage of cruell and insolent enemies,
    robbing, spoiling, burning, wasting, all before them: to which,<span class="sni"><i>Gildas.</i></span>
    plague, pestilence, and famine being joyned, the inland part of the
    <i>Island</i>, even to the Western <i>Ocean</i> was welnear totally
    consumed.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Countrey was so oppress’d, what with outward hostile
    miseries, what with intestine tumults and troubles: that, had they not
    lost the <i>practice of all Arts</i> (as the former Historian saith
    they had) so far were they from erecting any work of this kind, that
    they were compelled to abandon their Towns, and houses, built in times
    foregoing by their Auncestors, and betake themselves to mountains,
    caves, and woods for shelter. Now, if the calamities of those times
    hung over the <i>Britans</i> heads, in so generall manner, that not one
    amongst them had leisure to put pen to paper, (as from <i>Leyland</i>
    before remembred) much lesse able were they, without all peradventure,
    to undertake so great a work as <i>Stoneheng</i>, wherein, as all
    rationall men must grant, numbers of men employed, and many years taken
    up, before brought to its absolute perfection.</p>

  <p>But, nothing can better expresse the ignorance of that Age, then
    the barbarous manner of inscription upon the Tomb of the <i>British
    Hector</i> King <i>Arthur</i>, nephew to <i>A. Ambrosius</i>, found
    long since in the Churchyard of the Abbey at <i>Glastenbury</i>,
    the letters whereof, being exactly represented to our view by
    <i>Camden</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo. 228.</i></span> do, as by demonstration, fully discover to us the
    Barbarism of those times. As, barbarous in those characters, so were
    they ignorant in, and had lost the use of all other <i>Arts</i>.
    <i>Nor exercise nor practice of good Arts, was then amongst them</i>,
    saith the Historiographer of <i>Malmsbury</i>. And well he might so
    deliver himself, not withstand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>ing <i>Matthew Westminster</i> tels
    us, <i>A. Ambrosius</i> repaired <i>Churches</i>, which the rage of
    <i>Saxons</i>, enemies to <i>Christian Religion</i>, spoiled. For,
    besides, the vast difference betwixt such works as <i>Stoneheng</i>,
    where <i>Art</i> overmasters the common skill of man, and making up
    the decaies of ruinated buildings, is apprehensive even to the meanest
    capacities: <i>Gildas</i> and <i>Bede</i> (whose Antiquity and learning
    the greater it is, the more is their authority acceptable) affirm,
    the <i>Britans</i> in those times knew not in what manner to bring
    up bare wals of stone. When, the <i>Roman</i> Legion sent to aid the
    <i>Britans</i> by <i>Valentinian</i> the third, under the conduct of
    <i>Gallio</i> of <i>Ravenna</i>, was remanded hence, for defence of
    <i>France</i>; before departing, they exhorted the <i>Britans</i>
    to make a wall overthwart the <i>Island</i>, to secure themselves
    from the <i>Barbarians</i>, <i>Picts</i>, and <i>Scots</i>: which
    wall, <i>Bede</i> tels us, <i>was made not so much with stone, as
    turffes, considering they had no workmen to bring up such works of
    stone; and so</i>, (saith the venerable Historian) <i>they did set up
    one, good for nothing. ’Twas made by the rude, and unskilfull common
    multitude, not so much of stone, as turffes</i> (saith <i>Gildas</i>
    also) <i>none being found able to give direction for building works
    of stone</i>. This was about thirty six years preceding <i>A.
    Ambrosius</i> government. In which time, the <i>Romans</i> abandoning
    <i>Britain</i>, <i>Vortigern</i> usurped; call’d in the <i>Saxons</i>
    to his aid; was deposed by his Nobility; and <i>Vortimer</i> his son
    set up. Whom <i>Rowena</i> having made away; <i>Vortigern</i> was
    re-enthronis’d. Him <i>A. Ambrosius</i> invades, and having burnt him,
    together with <i>Rowena</i> in <i>Wales</i>, assumes the Crown as his;
    holding continuall war with the <i>Saxons</i>, untill poysoned by
    <i>Pascentius</i> as aforesaid.</p>

  <p>It being thus, that nothing but universall confusion, and destructive
    broyls of war, appeared then in all parts; more ancient, and far more
    propitious times, must be sought out for designing a structure, so
    exquisite in the composure as this: even such a flourishing Age, as
    when <i>Architecture</i> in rare perfection, and such <i>People</i>
    lookt upon, as by continuall successe, attaining unto the sole power
    over <i>Arts</i>, as well as <i>Empires</i>, commanded all. I say, such
    <i>Times</i>, and <i>Persons</i>, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>cause those things, which accord
    not with the course of time, which by a generall consent of Authors
    agree not; which by the approved customes of ancient Ages, and votes
    of learned men, are not received and allowed, and consequently no ways
    probable; I easily admit not of.</p>

  <p>Another fiction there is concerning <i>Stoneheng</i>, not to be past
    over; and though the cause upon which it’s grounded, be far more
    ancient then the government of <i>Ambrosius</i>, or aforesaid slaughter
    of the <i>Britains</i>: neverthelesse, in respect it is a new conceit,
    not thirty years being past since hatch’t, I suppose this the most
    proper place to discourse thereof, having ended with <i>Geffrey
    Monmouth</i>, <i>Polydore Virgill</i>, and their followers.</p>

  <p>The Author thereof is <i>Anonymus</i>, unlesse known in being
    Translator of <i>Lucius Florus</i>. His opinion, (in his <i>Nero
    Cæsar</i>) <i>Stoneheng</i> the Tomb of <i>Boadicia</i> (formerly
    remembred) Queen of the <i>Iceni</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 181.</i></span> His reasons, first, because that
    memorable battell betwixt her, and <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i> fought
    upon a Plain. Secondly, in respect the <i>Britans</i> buried her
    magnificently. For confirming this, he tels us, <i>Had the pretieus
    volumes of the</i> Cornelian <i>Annals, and</i> Dio Cassius, <i>and</i>
    John Xiphiline <i>been within the spheare of</i> Geffrey Monmouths
    <i>studies, not</i> Aurelus Ambrosius, <i>nor those four hundred and
    sixty Noblemen of</i> Britain, <i>murthered in</i> Vortigerns <i>reign,
    should have carried away with him the fame of this materiall wonder,
    but magnanimous</i> Boadicia. It seems, he would not be behinde-hand
    with <i>Monmouth</i>; for, as the one finding no story more famous
    then of <i>A. Ambrosius</i> and the slaughtered <i>Britans</i>,
    fathered <i>Stoneheng</i> upon them: so, to make the inventive
    faculty, as apparently predominant in himself; this other, respecting
    <i>Boadicia’s</i> heroicall actions, would as willingly make the world
    beleeve this <i>Antiquity</i> her Monument.</p>

  <p>His principall argument I delivered before; to wit, the battell
    betwixt Her and the <i>Romans</i>, wherein <i>Boadicia</i> utterly
    overthrown too, being fought upon a Plain. Was there in old time
    (did he think) no Plain in <i>Britain</i> to fight a battell on
    but <i>Salisbury</i> Plain? How came <i>Boadicia</i> and her Army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
    thither? I find indeed, <i>Boadicia</i> leading one hundred and twenty
    thousand fighting men out of the <i>Icenian</i> Countries, and like
    a terrible tempest, falling upon <i>Camalodunum</i>, that famous
    <i>Roman</i> Colony of old, (where the first fury of the War was felt)
    she surprised it and razed it to the ground; <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i>
    then in <i>Anglesey</i>: Intercepting <i>Petilius Cerealis</i>, who
    advanced with the ninth legion to relieve that Colony, she cut all his
    Infantry in peeces: Putting to the sword all those, which imbecillity
    of sex, tediousnesse of age, or pleasure of the place detained from
    following <i>Suetonius</i> in his march from <i>London</i>: And taking
    <i>Verulamium</i>, sackt and burnt it down to ashes. But, how she
    marcht from thence to <i>Salisbury</i> Plain is neither apparent nor
    probable; not the least inkling being left in the world, what hostile
    acts she committed, which way she moved, or what done by her, after the
    ruine of <i>Verulam</i>, till utterly overthrown.</p>

  <p>Can it be imagined, she that destroyed so great a Colony, together
    with a free-borough of the <i>Romans</i>, slain seventy or eighty
    thousand persons in such horrid manner as scarce credible; reserving
    not one Prisoner alive, but killing, hanging, crucifying, and burning
    whatsoever <i>Romane</i>, or to that party enclined: that was yet
    victorious, and her Army encreasing daily; can it be imagined, I say,
    she marcht to <i>Salisbury</i> Plain with so huge an Army invisibly?
    or stole from <i>Verulam</i> thither by night, lest notice should
    be taken of her proceedings? <i>Anonymus</i> self cannot think so
    unworthily of his <i>Boadicia</i>, yet certainly after such manner
    she went, if ever went thither at all: Otherwise, <i>Boadicia</i>
    marching in the height of glory, and bearing down all before her
    till rancountred by <i>Suetonius</i>. Those faithfull Historians
    <i>Tacitus</i>, and <i>Dion</i>, (both so sedulous in delivering
    her Fame to posterity) would never have omitted so notable a march,
    through such a large tract of enemies Countrey, as of necessity she
    was to make from <i>Verulam</i>, to <i>Salisbury</i> Plain; but would
    have prosecuted her War, by recording the spoyls, rapines, burnings,
    and devastations made therein; as particularly, as from the first
    fomenting the rebellion, till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> her advance to <i>Verulam</i>, they
    have done. Upon which Town, and the aforementioned places only, the
    aforesaid Historians directly tell us the whole burden of the War fell.<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</i></span>
    <i>Ad Septuaginta millia civium &amp; sociorum iis quæ memoravi locis
    occidisse constitit</i>, saith <i>Tacitus</i>. <i>It was manifest,
    there were slain in the places, I have remembred, the number of
    seventy thousand Citizens and Allies.</i> Bunduica <i>duas urbes</i>
    (saith <i>Xiphilines Dion</i><span class="sni"><i>Dion. Cas. lib. 62.</i></span> also) <i>populi</i> Romani <i>expugnavit
    atque diripuit, in iísque cædem infinitam, ut supradixi, fecit.</i>
    Bunduica <i>took and razed to the ground two Towns of the</i> Romans,
    <i>and in them made that infinite slaughter, I have mentioned before,
    of fourscore thousand persons</i>. At <i>Verulam</i> then, it fully
    appears, the course of her Victories stopt, the inhumane butchery of
    the <i>Romans</i>, and their confederates, ended with the massacre
    in that Town; which could not possibly have hapned, if with such a
    firm resolution to extirpate the <i>Roman</i> name in <i>Britain</i>,
    and such a numerous Army to effect it, she had gone on victoriously
    unfought with, so far as where this <i>Antiquity</i> stands. And
    therefore the Plain of <i>Salisbury</i> could not be the place of
    battell, as <i>Anonymus</i> would fain enforce it. Who having so
    largely, and with so good advice, discoursed the motions, and actions
    of this rebellion, with all the circumstances thereof, from the first
    rise, till she destroyed <i>Verulam</i>, should either have found some
    warrantable authority for <i>Boadicia’s</i> so great an undertaking
    afterwards, else never engaged her so far within the <i>Roman</i>
    Province; otherwise, some may imagine, he framed it, only out of
    ambition for a meer pretence, rather, then stated it, from a reall
    endeavour, to make discovery for what cause <i>Stoneheng</i> at first
    erected.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i> was too well skilled in the
    discipline of war, to make the seat thereof in a Countrey so absolutely
    <i>Roman</i>, as betwixt the <i>British</i> Ocean and the River
    <i>Thames</i>. He had it’s true (being return’d from <i>Anglesey</i>)
    abandoned <i>London</i>, no colony. But upon what result? finding
    his accesse of strength disproportionable to the War in hand, and
    therefore<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</i></span> <i>determined with the losse of one Town to preserve the rest
    whole</i>, (whether <i>London</i> or <i>Camalodunum</i> is not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> the
    purpose) and, by attending the motions of the enemy, wait all fair
    occasions to give <i>Boadicia</i> battell,<span class="sni"><i>Dion. Cass. lib. 62.</i></span> <i>being unwilling to try
    his fortune too suddenly, multitude and successe making the</i> Britans
    <i>outrageously daring</i>. In the interim neverthelesse, raising what
    forces, the exigency of so important affairs would permit.</p>

  <p>Which way <i>Suetonius</i> marched from <i>London</i> is altogether
    omitted, yet if lawfull to conjecture, why not? to draw off the
    Forces of <i>Catus Decianus</i> Procurator, (not long before fled
    into <i>Gaul</i>, for fear of this War) together with the remains
    of <i>Petilius Cerealis</i> troops; quartered, as <i>Anonymus</i>
    confesseth,<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 105.</i></span> in those very camps yet appearing about <i>Gildsbrough</i>
    and <i>Daintry</i> in <i>Northamptonshire</i>, then, confining the
    <i>Icenian</i> Dominion to the Westward. Which Troops therefore, lay
    doubtlesse, in very great danger if not timely relieved; especially in
    case <i>Boadicia</i> should conduct her Army that way; as, ere long
    afterwards she did so far as <i>Verulam</i>; this course being taken
    by her, not improbably, in pursuit of <i>Suetonius</i>. Neither was
    it very dangerous for the <i>Roman</i> Generall to lead his Forces
    that way, the Enemies main strength lying about <i>Camalodunum</i>.
    Howsoever, whether he marched up to them or no, concluded it is,
    he made his retreat towards <i>Pœnius Posthumus</i> encamped with
    the <i>second Legion</i> in the borders of the <i>Silures</i>,
    (now <i>Herefordshire</i>, <i>Radnorshire</i> &amp;c.) for which
    <i>Legion</i>, <i>Suetonius</i> sending to have it brought up to
    his Rendezvouz, his commands being slighted, that strength failed
    him. <i>The way which</i> Suetonius <i>took,<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 154.</i></span> after his departure,
      was in mine opinion</i> (saith <i>Anonymus</i>) <i>towards</i>
    Severn, <i>where</i> Pœnius Posthumus <i>encamped with the second
    Legion among the</i> Silures. So also <i>Spencer</i> our famous
    <i>English</i> Poet finds it. Whereby it appears, <i>Suetonius</i>
    retreat was not Westward to <i>Salisbury</i> Plains, but Northerly
    towards that <i>second Legion</i>. In this retreat, I may not omit,
    <i>Anonymus</i> conducts him over the <i>Thames</i> at <i>London</i>;<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 155.</i></span>
    which if granted, and, <i>that he kept the river upon his right hand
    still</i>, untill engaging <i>Boadicia</i>, as <i>Anonymus</i> saith
    he did: then was <i>Suetonius</i> march <i>far away</i> indeed from
    <i>Salisbury</i> Plain. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> course of that River winding, as we
    all know, through <i>Barkshire</i> out of <i>Oxfordshire</i>, where
    <i>Tame</i> from the County <i>Buckingham</i>, and <i>Isis</i> from
    the edge of <i>Glocester</i> Province, make their conjunction a little
    beneath <i>Dorchester</i>. And, if keeping this course <i>still</i>
    by the Rivers side, <i>Suetonius</i> marcht alongst the banks of
    <i>Cherwell</i> also, then must <i>Anonymus</i>, whether he will or
    no, bring him up close to <i>Gildsbrough</i> and <i>Daintry</i>, as
    aforesaid;<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 166.</i></span> and thereby (for it is admitted <i>Cerealis</i> horse-troops
    were at the fight) reconciling all opinions, upon his direct way
    towards the <i>second Legion</i>.</p>

  <p>How far on, neverthelesse, toward <i>Pœnius Posthumus</i> Camp
    <i>Suetonius</i> advanced is uncertain; but, that the battell might be
    fought in some Plain about <i>Verulam</i>, or upon that rode, is not
    altogether improbable. (Especially considering part of <i>Suetonius</i>
    strength consisted of <i>Londoners</i>, who, as <i>Auxiliaries</i>
    followed him in this War, and would not stay behind). For, the
    <i>Roman</i> Generall when marshalling his Army for fight, had with
    him (saith <i>Tacitus</i>) <i>the aids of the places adjoyning</i>.
    What places were these? the last <i>place</i> named by him was
    <i>Verulam</i>, the next place before it <i>London</i>; and, if the
    Historian intends either of these two, by the <i>places adjoyning</i>
    to the field, where the battell fought; then, may <i>Anonymus</i>
    prove the desarts in <i>Africa</i>, as soon as the Plains of
    <i>Salisbury</i>, to be the place of Battell.</p>

  <p><i>Spencer</i> saith,<span class="sni"><i>Cant. 10.</i></span> the battell was fought near <i>Severn</i>:</p>

  <p><i>Suetonius</i>, when resolving for fight,<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</i></span> <i>deligit locum artis
    faucibus, &amp; à tergo silvâ clausum, satis cognito, nihil hostium nisi
    in fronte, &amp; apertam planitiem esse sine metu insidiarum. Choosed
    a place with a narrow entrance, enclosed behind with a wood, being
    well assured, he had no enemies but before him, and the Plain being
    open was without fear of Ambush.</i> Thus <i>Tacitus</i> describes
    the field, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> <i>Roman</i> Army consisting of scarce ten thousand
    armed men. In what part of <i>Britan</i> soever this Plain lay, it
    was, for certain, of no great extent, being hardly able to contain
    the vast multitudes of <i>Boadicia’s</i> Army; computed two hundred
    and thirty thousand fighting men, by <i>Dion</i>, and therefore could
    not possibly be <i>Salisbury</i> Plain. For, the <i>Britans</i>
    placing their carts and wagons <i>supra extremum ambitium campi, in
    the utmost borders of the field</i>, had so environed their Army
    therewith, that upon the rout given, they could hardly flee away,
    <i>quia circumjecta vehicula sepserant abitus, by reason the carts</i>
    (saith <i>Tacitus</i>) <i>hedged in the passages on every side</i>,
    and (to use <i>Anonymus</i> own words)<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 179.</i></span> <i>were like a wall against
    evasion</i>. Now, if the <i>Britans</i> had so surrounded the utmost
    borders of <i>Salisbury</i> Plain, and in such manner barricado’d
    up all the passages thereof, their numbers should rather have been
    millions then thousands, as every man knowing those Plains must needs
    confesse. Besides, <i>Anonymus</i> self tels us,<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 178.</i></span> <i>after the</i>
    Britans <i>in the head of their battel began to shrink and turn, that
    alone was a blow to all behind, who being many score of thousands,
    remain’d untoucht, during the fight, because they could never come up
    to handy-strokes, for</i> want of room <i>in the narrowings of the
    field</i>. He told us even now there was scope enough. <i>Whereabout
    in these parts of</i> Britain, (saith he)<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 161.</i></span> <i>that very place was,
    unlesse it were upon</i> Salisbury <i>Plain, where there is a black
    heath, and</i> scope enough, <i>is not for me to imagine</i>. Now,
    on the contrary, when coming to the issue, he tels us the Plain was
    narrow, and they <i>wanted room</i>. Did the <i>Britans</i> want
    room in the field, and were on <i>Salisbury</i> Plain? Surely, in
    the heat of his describing the Battel <i>Anonymus</i> forgot his
    own invention; the fury of the <i>Romans</i>, in beating down the
    <i>British</i> squadrons, therewith dasht the main force of his conceit
    to peeces. Suspicious and jealous men had need of good memories. Upon
    the aforesaid situation he might rather have observed, the great
    experience of the <i>Romane Generall</i> in martiall affairs, then
    from thence suggested, the <i>Britans</i> in point of honour erected
    <i>Stoneheng</i> to the memory of <i>Boadicia</i>, <i>Suetonius</i>
    not onely choosing to make good a straight enclosed behinde with a
    wood, for secu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>ring his own small Troops, but such a straight also,
    where the Plain, or field before it, was not of sufficient extent
    for <i>Boadicia</i> to marshall her great Army in. Furthermore,
    <i>Anonymus</i> determining (it seems) to parcell out his ground
    proportionable to the numbers, undertakes to give posterity an exact
    survey of this Plain, telling us, it <i>was a Plain of five or six
    miles over</i>: This makes it more apparent ’twas not <i>Salisbury</i>
    Plain, which far and wide so expatiates it self through the middle
    of <i>Wiltshire</i>, that it is not onely <i>five or six miles</i>,
    but (as I may say) five times six miles over. This famous battell
    then, being struck upon a Plain hardly capable of <i>Boadicia’s</i>
    Army, was not fought upon <i>Salisbury</i> Plain; but, on some other,
    which <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i> found best for his own advantage, and
    therefore <i>Stoneheng</i> (as <i>Anonymus</i> would fain have it)
    could not be the Sepulchre of <i>Boadicia</i>.</p>

  <span class="sni"><i>Dion. Cass. lib. 62.</i></span>

  <p>Concerning <i>Boadicia’s</i> magnificent obsequies; a mighty Prince may
    be buried with great solemnity, yet no materiall Monument dedicated
    to his memory. Examples of this kinde are so frequent, there needs no
    mention of them. <i>Humaverunt magnificè</i>, (they are <i>Dions</i>
    words) the <i>Britans</i> laid her into the earth magnificently, with
    as much pomp, happily, and honour, attending her to the grave, as their
    barbarous customs for their glorious Chieftain would admit; but, that
    they raised any Monument, or erected whatsoever kinde of Sepulchre
    for her, much lesse so notable a structure as <i>Stoneheng</i>, he no
    where tels us. Which had the <i>Britans</i> done, the Historian could
    not avoid, taking more knowledge thereof, then of her bare enterment,
    and would undoubtedly have recorded it. Again, grant <i>Salisbury</i>
    Plain the place of Battell, yet, <i>Dion</i> saith not, they buried
    her magnificently where the battell fought, only, <i>Humaverunt
    magnificè</i>: adding withall, those, that escaped the field, prepared
    to re-enforce themselves for a new triall, in the mean while a disease
    seizing on <i>Bunduica</i>, she died. Now then, after so terrible
    an overthrow, wherein ’tis reported she lost fourscore thousand
    <i>Britans</i>; <i>Boadicia</i>, in all likelihood, endevoured to
    recover the <i>Icenian</i> Countreys, her principall strength; having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    in her speech before the Battell insinuated the fenny parts thereof, as
    a refuge if the worst should happen. In what Countreys else could they
    recruit? where falling sick she died, (whether by violent or naturall
    death is not materiall) and as ever observed among all Nations, was, no
    doubt, buried in her own territories, among the graves of her renowned
    Ancestors.</p>

  <p>That the <i>Britans</i>, untill <i>Julius Agricolas</i> time,<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 117.</i></span> had
    learned nothing (as <i>Anonymus</i> takes speciall notice) but <i>to
    fight, and were no handicraftsmen</i>, whereby they might be capable
    of erecting such works as <i>Stoneheng</i>, being already fully
    proved from <i>Tacitus</i>, I will adde, the ringleaders or heads of
    commotions against Empires and Commonwealths were anciently, (in many
    Countreys at this day) not only themselves punishable by the Laws
    with death, but their whole families and kindred though guiltlesse,
    suffered in like manner; their very houses also, being razed to the
    ground, lest any knowledge of such pernicious undertakings should
    remain visible to posterity: and a capitall crime it was, in whomsoever
    that restor’d them. How comes it then, <i>Boadicia</i> the principall
    promoter,<span class="sni"><i>Sueton. in Ner.</i></span> and Head of an insurrection so fatall, as accounted by
    <i>Suetonius Tranquillus</i>, among the infortunate losses of the
    <i>Roman</i> Empire,<span class="sni"><i>Dion. Cas. lib. 62.</i></span> and the more ignominious by a womans conduct,
    should be permitted by the conquering <i>Romans</i>, a monument to
    eternize her fame to succeeding Ages? <i>Boadicia</i>, that ript up the
    bellies of the <i>Roman</i> Legionaries, and cutting out their bowels
    impal’d their bodies upon burning stakes; that hanged up the most noble
    and honourable <i>Roman Dames</i> naked, and slicing off their paps,
    sowed them to their mouths, as in act of eating them; that in scalding
    water boiled the <i>Roman</i> infants, and young children to death;
    their Parents, Husbands, and Commanders unable to relieve them, but
    enforced to give way, and happy in so saving themselves from the cruell
    inhumanities of the <i>Conqueresse</i>. <i>We fought for to live</i>,
    saith <i>Tacitus</i>. Yet, when ere long afterwards, victoriously
    recovering <i>Britain</i> to <i>Cæsar</i>, by so memorable a battell as
    compared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> their victories of old, should the <i>Romans</i> suffer
    the enthralled <i>Britans</i> to erect a Trophy to her memory, whose
    purpose was absolutely to root out all that was <i>Roman</i> here?
    what greater infamy to the <i>Roman</i> name, except the permission
    of it? They, who rased and broke in peeces whatever titles and
    inscriptions, bearing the names of their <i>Cæsars</i>; pulled down and
    demolished the royall <i>Ensigns</i>, <i>Trophies</i>, <i>Statues</i>,
    <i>Temples</i>, or whatever else sacred, to their own Emperors,
    when actively administring to the prejudice of the <i>Romane</i>
    State; would they permit any publick monuments be erected to the
    memory of a conquered Prince, of an Enemy so barbarously cruell as
    <i>Boadicia</i>? That she lives in History, they could not prevent; so
    live their worst of Emperors. Moreover, publick Monuments were in all
    ages set up in honour of the Vanquishers, not vanquished; respecting
    which, <i>Anonymus</i> should also, either have made <i>Boadicia</i>
    Victresse, or never supposed <i>Stoneheng</i> her Sepulchre.</p>

  <p>The time assigned by <i>Anonymus</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Ner. Cæs. fo. 182.</i></span> for erecting these <i>orderly
    irregular, and formlesse uniform heaps of massive marble</i>, (as
    he cals them) <i>to the everlasting remembrance of Boadicia</i>, is
    much above fifteen hundred years since: <i>Petronius Turpilianus</i>
    succeeding <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i> in the Leivtenancy of
    <i>Britain</i>; who by his idle and lazy life, making the world beleeve
    there was peace here: <i>Anonymus</i> will have it a proper time, for
    permitting <i>such an office to the Britans</i>, in <i>Boadicia’s</i>
    honour. Times of peace, ’tis confest, when <i>Arts</i> flourish under
    nobly minded Governours, are chiefly proper for erecting magnificent
    buildings. The Government under <i>Petronius</i> was guilty of none of
    these. As for the State of <i>Britain</i> in generall, <i>Tacitus</i>
    in the life of <i>Agricola</i> tels us, <i>Petronius</i> had composed
    the former troubles; but in what sort, the fourteenth book of his
    <i>Annals</i> declares; <i>non irritato hoste, neque lacessitus,
    neither the Enemy, incensed him; nor he, provoked the Enemy</i>:
    otherwise <i>Petronius</i> durst not do. And, if peace setled, why
    doth the Historian call them Enemies? Concerning his own person in
    particular, <i>Petronius</i> gave himself over to an unprofitable
    life, disguising it under the honourable name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> of peace. <i>Honestum
    pacis nomen segni otio imposuit</i>, saith <i>Tacitus</i>. And,
    the <i>Britans</i> (as said before) were not then civilized, nor
    friends to such Arts as either nourish or are nourished by peace,
    therefore such a work of wonder as this <i>Antiquity</i> famed, not
    to be expected from them. For, as through the malignities of the
    Age, wherein <i>Aurelius Ambrosius</i> lived, the <i>Britans</i> had
    utterly lost the practice of all those <i>Sciences</i>, in times
    foregoing, learned by their Auncestors from the <i>Romans</i>: so,
    through the neglect of civil policy in the preceding <i>Roman</i>
    Governours, in this Leivtenancy of <i>Petronius</i>, the <i>Britans</i>
    had not attained the knowledge of any those <i>Arts</i>, not many
    years afterwards, taught their posterity by the <i>Romans</i>. Whole
    imperiall Eagles took not wing in <i>Britain</i> with such lofty
    speed, as over other Countreys; <i>The</i> Britans <i>being a fierce
    Nation, slowly giving ear to any peace</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</i></span> the <i>Romans</i> had
    work enough in subduing them. <i>Julius Cæsar</i> rather shewed
    the Island to his successors, then left them possession of it:
    <i>Augustus</i> and <i>Tiberius</i> held it policy to neglect it:
    <i>Caligula</i> intending to invade <i>Britain</i>, was diverted by
    his Wars in <i>Germany</i>: <i>Claudius</i> first prosecuting the
    conquest with effect, established the colony at <i>Camalodunum</i>,
    and his Leivtenants <i>Aulus Plautius</i>, <i>Flavius Vespasianus</i>,
    <i>Ostorius Scapula</i>, and <i>Didius Gallus</i> by little and little,
    after much contest, and various successe, subdued certain Countries;
    and reducing the nearest part of the Island to the form of a Province,
    built also, or rather cast up some few fortifications further within
    the land: <i>Nero’s</i> Generals had much to do in keeping, what their
    predecessors gained; <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i> (under him) struck
    that fortunate battell with <i>Boadicia</i>, else the <i>Romans</i>
    beaten out of all. So that, in the time of <i>Petronius</i>, the
    <i>Romans</i> having obtained no such assured dominion over the
    <i>Britans</i>, as might make them, themselves confident to undertake
    great and stately buildings here, for their own either publick, or
    private accommodations; (the ruine of <i>Camalodunum</i> being too
    fresh in memory) occasion was not offered, nor the time yet come, to
    let the <i>Britans</i> know by what <i>Arts</i> all civill Nations
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> the world, did erect their excessive, rather then not magnificent
    structures, for eternizing their names to succeeding generations.
    And therefore, the Leivtenancy of <i>Petronius Turpilianus</i>, not
    proper for building this <i>stony marvell</i>, as <i>Anonymus</i>
    suspects. For, beside what’s delivered, whensoever <i>Stoneheng</i>
    built, the preparation only of materials for the work, and bringing
    them to the place, what <i>Engines</i> or <i>Arts</i> soever used,
    necessarily, spent more time, then <i>Petronius</i> consumed in the
    whole continuance of his government here. What tumults succeeded him,
    let others declare.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, <i>if those</i> times of <i>Petronius</i> would not,
    <i>yet</i> (saith <i>Anonymus</i>) <i>other ensuing seasons might
    permit such an office to the</i> Britans, <i>her name for ever glorious
    among them</i>. The hainousnesse of her Rebellion, horridnesse of
    her cruelties, and inveterate hatred <i>Boadicia</i> bore to the
    <i>Romans</i>, whereby <i>her name for ever infamous among them</i>,
    clearly manifest all other <i>ensuing seasons</i>, equally improper for
    those ancient inhabitants of this Island, to erect <i>Stoneheng</i>.
    If the <i>Britans</i>, once attaining the <i>Romane</i> manner
    of <i>Architecture</i>, in any succeeding times had expelled the
    <i>Romans</i>, and been triumphant; some probable reason, at least,
    <i>Anonymus</i> might have alledged, towards advancing his opinion.
    But <i>Boadicia</i> and her <i>Complices</i> overthrown, the
    <i>Roman</i> Power in this Island encreasing dayly, and the liberty
    of the <i>Britans</i> as fast declining, no following <i>season</i>
    could be opportunely favourable, for undertaking such a work by
    them; the erecting whereof, yea the sole endeavouring to commemorate
    by such publick means, so mortall an enemy to the <i>Romans</i>
    as <i>Boadicia</i>: nothing but the dearest lives of the bold
    attempters, could, certainly, expiate. The <i>Temple</i> upon Mount
    <i>Cœlius</i> at <i>Rome</i>, begun to <i>Claudius</i><span class="sni"><i>Suet. in Vespas.</i></span> sacred memory by
    <i>Agrippina</i>, was destroyed to the very foundations by <i>Nero</i>.
    If then, insulting <i>Agrippina</i> might not erect a memorable
    structure, to the glory of her deceased <i>Cæsar</i>; whom the
    <i>Senate</i> and <i>People</i> of <i>Rome</i>, in all solemne manner
    deified: What oppressed <i>Britan</i>, durst undertake the raising a
    publick Monument to the honour of vanquished <i>Boadicia</i>, whom the
    State (in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> reason) for ever declared enemy to the <i>Roman</i>
    Empire? And though, after a long succession of years, the <i>Romans</i>
    abandoned this Island, yet, when departed, the <i>Britans</i> were left
    in such deplorable condition, (at large declared before) that, albeit
    <i>her name</i> never so glorious among them, they had much more to
    do, in saving their own miserable lives from plague, famine, and the
    sword, then any opportunity, or ability to erect whatever Monument
    to the glory of <i>Boadicia</i>. But, of this enough; the invalidity
    of <i>Anonymus</i> opinion especially respected. The discovering the
    originall foundation of an <i>Antiquity</i> so famous, being not to
    be enforced by jealous suspicions, raised upon bare and groundlesse
    conjectures.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p><span class="gespertt1">THIS</span> <i>Antiquity</i> (call’d by <i>Henry Huntingdon, The second</i>:
    by <i>Poly-olbion</i><br />

  </p>

  <p class="noindent">because the <i>Architraves</i> are set upon the heads
    of the upright stones, and hang (as it were) in the air, is
    generally known by the name of <i>Stone-heng</i>. It is sited upon
    the Plain in the County of <i>Wiltshire</i> in <i>England</i>,
    not far from <i>Ambresbury</i> (the foundations of whose ancient
    buildings, frequently digged up, render it to have been in times
    past a <i>Town</i> of no small fame) six miles at least from new
    <i>Salisbury</i> northwards.</p>

  <p>The whole work, in generall, being of a circular form, is one
    hundred and ten foot diameter, double winged about without a roof,
    anciently environed with a deep Trench, still appearing about thirty
    foot broad. So that, betwixt it, and the work it self, a large and
    void space of ground being left, it had, from the Plain, three open
    entrances, the most conspicuous thereof lying North-east. At each
    of which, was raised, on the outside of the Trench aforesaid, two
    huge stones gate-wise, parallel whereunto, on the inside two others
    of lesse proportion. The inner part of the work, consisting of an
    <i>Exagonall</i> figure, was raised, by due symmetry, upon the bases
    of four equilaterall triangles, (which formed the whole structure)
    this inner part likewise was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> double, having, within it also, another
    <i>Exagon</i> raised, and all that part within the Trench sited upon a
    commanding ground, eminent, and higher by much, then any of the Plain
    lying without, and, in the midst thereof, upon a foundation of hard
    chalk, the work it self was placed. Insomuch, from what part soever
    they came unto it, they rose by an easie ascending hill.</p>

  <p>Which, that it may be the more clearly demonstrated, (being by me,
    with no little pains, and charge measured, and the foundations thereof
    diligently searched) I have reduced into <i>Design</i>, not onely as
    the ruine thereof now appears, but as (in my judgement) it was in its
    pristine perfection. And that the groundplot, with the uprights, and
    profyle of the whole work may the more distinctly be understood, I have
    purposely countersigned each <i>Design</i> of them with <i>Numbers</i>,
    and the particular parts thereof with <i>Letters</i>.</p>

  <p>The Work it self; in the inmost part whereof, there is a stone
    appearing not much above the surface of the earth, (and lying towards
    the East) four foot broad, and sixteen foot in length. Which, whether
    it might be an <i>Altar</i> or no, I leave to the judgement of others,
    because so overwhelmed with the ruines of the Work, that I could make
    no search after it, but even with much difficulty, took the aforesaid
    proportion thereof. Yet for my part, I can apprehend no valid reason
    to the contrary, except that the whole constructure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> being circular in
    form, the Altar should rather have been placed upon the center of the
    Circle, then enclining to the circumference. Neverthelesse it cannot
    be denied, but being so sited, the <i>Cell</i> (as I may call it) was
    thereby left more free, for the due performance of those severall
    superstitious rites, which their Idolatry led them to. Besides,
    though the <i>Altare</i> amongst the <i>Ancients</i> was exalted
    and raised somwhat high above the earth; yet, their <i>Ara</i> was
    made quadrangular, not very high, and as some will have it close to
    the ground, being consecrated as well to the supernall as infernall
    Deities:<span class="sni"><i>Rosin. lib. 2.</i></span> and therefore in respect of the form, it may hold well enough

    <i>Architraves</i>, being joynted directly in the middle of each of the
    perpendicular stones that their weight might have an equall bearing,
    and upon each side of the joynt a tenon wrought, (as remains yet to be

  <p>The smaller stones of the inner circle, one foot and an half in bredth,

    them, but were raised perpendicular, of a pyramidall form. That, there
    was no <i>Architrave</i> upon these, may be hence concluded, the stones
    being too small to carry such a weight, the spaces being also too wide,
    to admit of an <i>Architrave</i> upon them without danger of breaking,
    and being but six foot high, there could not, possibly, be a convenient
    head-height remaining for a passage underneath, especially, considering

  <p>Hitherto, upon what occasion <i>Stoneheng</i> built (you may easily
    perceive) is very doubtfull, the true History of those times, when
    first erected, and by which the memory of things especially made over
    to succeeding Ages, being either not written, or if written, utterly
    lost. Likewise, as for what use set up, not yet known; so, by whom also
    founded, is equally uncertain.</p>

  <p>You cannot but remember, in what manner the ancient Inhabitants of
    this Island lived, before reduced to civility by the <i>Romans</i>
    I have formerly delivered: also, how they were first instructed
    by them, in severall <i>Arts</i> and <i>Sciences</i>, whereof the
    <i>Britans</i> wholly ignorant, before the <i>Romans</i> arrivall
    here, and teaching them. I have given you in like manner, a full
    description of this <i>Antiquity</i>, whereby doubtlesse it appears to
    you, as in truth it is, a work built with much <i>Art</i>, <i>Order</i>
    and <i>Proportion</i>. That the ancient <i>Britans</i>, before the
    discovery of this Island by the <i>Romans</i>, could not be the
    <i>Founders</i> thereof, by the former reasons, I suppose, is clearly
    manifested. For, where <i>Art</i> is not, nothing can be performed by
    <i>Art</i>. As, for that which concerns the <i>British</i> Nobility,
    <i>Aurelius Ambrosius</i>, or <i>Boadicia</i>, enough already.</p>

  <p>It rests now, to endeavor the discovering by whom <i>Stoneheng</i>
    built; in what time, and, for what use anciently erected. But, it is
    not expected (I hope) any absolute resolution should be given by me, in
    so doubtfull a matter; for, <i>as it hath been always lawfull for every
    man in such like matters</i> (saith <i>Camden</i>) <i>both to think
    what he will, and relate what others have thought</i>: So pardon me, if
    I take upon me, what others have done before me, and interpose mine own
    opinion also, grounded neverthelesse upon such Authorities, customes,
    and concurrence of time, as very probably may satisfie judicious and
    impartiall Readers.</p>

  <p>Touching the <i>Founders</i> of <i>Stoneheng</i>. Among the <i>Ægyptian
    Antiquities</i>, or those <i>Eastern</i> Nations from whom the
    <i>Græcians</i> deduced their learning, I find not any such composure
    ever used: or with the <i>Greeks</i> themselves, mention made of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
    any work conformable to this, in point of <i>Order</i>, (as the mod
    conversant in those Histories cannot contradict) I read neverthelesse,
    in <i>Pausanias</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Pausan. fo. 392.</i></span> of a <i>Temple</i> amongst the <i>Eleans</i>
    erected without walls: <i>novam quandam in</i> Eleorum <i>foro templi
    formam vidi. I saw</i> (saith he) <i>in the market place of the</i>
    Eleans, <i>a Temple of a new form. Modicæ est ædes altitudinis, sine
    parietibus, tectum è quercu dolatis fulcientibus tibicinibus. A low
    thing, without walls, having the roof supported with props of oaken
    timber</i> (instead, it seems, of Columnes) <i>neatly wrought</i>. He
    remembers a <i>Temple</i> also in <i>Attica</i><span class="sni"><i>Idem fo. 75</i>:</span> sacred to <i>Jove</i>
    without a roof. The <i>Thracians</i> (as I read likewise) used to
    build <i>Temples</i> dedicated to <i>Sol</i>, <i>of a round form,
    open in the middle</i>, and also without a <i>roof</i>: by the form,
    or roundnesse thereof, they signified the Suns figure; by making them
    open, and rooflesse, they expressed his surmounting, and dilating light
    equally to all things. <i>Thraces soli rotunda templa faciebant</i>
    (saith <i>Daniel Barbaro</i>)<span class="sni"><i>In Vitr. lib. 4.</i></span> <i>in medio sub divo, &amp; aperta erant: hac
    forma Solis figuram innuebant: quòd autem aperta essent, &amp; sine tecto,
    innuebant Solem supra omnia esse, &amp; lumen suum diffundere</i>.</p>

  <p>Howsoever, considering what magnificence the <i>Romans</i> in
    prosperous times anciently used in all works, both publick, and
    private: their knowledge and experience in all <i>Arts</i> and
    <i>Sciences</i>: their powerfull means for effecting great works:
    together with their <i>Order</i> in building, and manner of workmanship
    accustomed amongst them: <i>Stoneheng</i> in my judgement was a work,
    built by the <i>Romans</i>, and they the sole <i>Founders</i> thereof.
    For, if look upon this <i>Antiquity</i>, as an admired and magnificent
    building, who more magnificent then the <i>Romans</i>?<span class="sni"><i>Scamoz. lib. 1. fo. 9.</i></span> <i>Essi
    soli frà i populi dell’ vniverso, con ogni termine di magnificenza
    edificarono tutti i generi d’edifici. They only amongst all the
    Nations of the Universe, erecting all sorts of buildings, with all
    kinds of magnificence</i>, saith <i>Scamozzo</i> in the first Book
    of his <i>Architecture</i>. If consider the <i>Art</i>, and elegant
    disposition thereof, all <i>Arts</i> and <i>Sciences</i> (we must
    know) were in full perfection with them, and <i>Architecture</i>,
    which amongst the <i>Greeks</i> was youthfull only, and vigo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>rous;
    under the <i>Romans</i> their <i>Empire</i> grown to the full height
    became manly and perfect, not in <i>inventions, and elegancy of forms
    alone, but also in exquisitenesse of Art, and excellency of materials.
    Salito al colmo l’imperio</i> Romano, <i>ella pure divenne virile e
    perfetta: non solo nelle inventioni, e nella elleganza delle forme,
    mà parimente nell’ esquisitezza dell’ artificio, e nella singolarità
    della materia</i>. As the same Author hath it. If take notice of their
    power and ways by which they effected such goodly structures, their
    means were not ordinary according to the common custome of other
    <i>People</i>; and why? because, besides particular <i>Artisans</i>
    practised in severall <i>Arts</i>, they employed in those their works
    whole bodies of their own <i>Armies</i>, and whatever Nations subdued
    by them. <i>The</i> Romans <i>were wont to exercise therein</i> (saith
    <i>Camden</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Camden fo. 64.</i></span> <i>their Souldiers, and the common multitude, upon great
    policy doing the same, left being idle they should grow factious, and
    affect alteration in the State. The</i> Britans <i>complained</i>
    (saith <i>Tacitus</i> likewise) <i>corpora &amp; manus contrivisse, that
    their bodies and hands were worn out, and consumed by the</i> Romans,
    <i>in bringing to effect their great and admired undertakings</i>: in
    that kind employing their slaves and prisoners also, as holding it,
    rather then by violent deaths to cut them off; more profitable for
    the <i>Commonwealth</i>, more exemplary for others, and far greater
    punishment for their Prisoners, to enjoyn them continuall labour.</p>

  <p>If observe <i>their Order</i> in building; the only <i>Order</i>
    of <i>Architecture</i>, which <i>Italy</i> may truly glory in the
    invention of, is the <i>Tuscane Order</i>, so called, because first
    found out by the <i>Tuscans</i>, that in a more then ordinary manner
    they might reverence their <i>Deities</i> in <i>Temples</i> composed
    thereof.<span class="sni"><i>Choul. fo. 5.</i></span> (<i>Janus</i> their first King, according to the common
    opinion of divers ancient Historians, being the first of all others,
    that built <i>Temples</i> to the Gods) Which <i>Order</i>, though first
    used by the <i>Tuscans</i>, certain it is, the <i>Romans</i> took from
    them, and brought it in use with other <i>Arts</i>, in severall parts
    of the world, as their conquests led them on. Now of this <i>Tuscan
    Order</i>, a plain, grave, and humble manner of <i>Building</i>, very
    solid and strong <i>Stoneheng</i> principally consists. So that,
    ob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>serving the <i>Order</i> whereof <i>Stoneheng</i> built, there being
    no such Elements known in this <i>Island</i> as distinct <i>Orders</i>
    of <i>Architecture</i>, untill the <i>Romans</i> introduced them,
    the very work it self, of so great <i>Antiquity</i>, declares the
    <i>Romans Founders</i> thereof. Who, that hath right judgement in
    <i>Architecture</i>, knows not the difference, and by the manner of
    their works how to distinguish <i>Ægyptian</i>, <i>Greek</i>, and
    <i>Roman</i> structures of old, also <i>Italian</i>, <i>French</i> and
    <i>Dutch</i> buildings in these modern times? Is not our Shipping by
    the mould thereof, known throughout the world <i>English</i> built?
    Who did not by the very <i>Order</i> of the work, assure himself, the
    body of the Church of S. <i>Paul London</i>, from its Tower to the
    West end anciently built by the <i>Saxons</i>: as the Quire thereof,
    from the said Tower to the East end by the <i>Normans</i>, it being
    <i>Gothick</i> work? yet that there might be a <i>Roman Temple</i>
    in old time standing in that place, I will not deny, the numbers of
    Oxeheads digged up and anciently sacrificed there, setting all other
    reasons aside, so probably manifesting the same. And in all likelihood,
    the <i>Romans</i> for so notable a structure as <i>Stoneheng</i>, made
    choice of the <i>Tuscane</i> rather then any other <i>Order</i>, not
    only as best agreeing with the rude, plain, simple nature of those they
    intended to instruct, and use for which erected; but also, because
    presuming to challenge a certain kind of propriety therein, they might
    take occasion thereby, to magnifie to those then living the virtue of
    their <i>Auncestors</i> for so noble an invention, and make themselves
    the more renowned to posterity, for erecting thereof, so well ordred a
    building.</p>

  <p>Besides, the <i>Order</i> is not only <i>Roman</i>, but the
    <i>Scheam</i> also (consisting of four equilaterall triangles,
    inscribed within the circumference of a Circle) by which this work
    <i>Stoneheng</i> formed, was an <i>Architectonicall Scheam</i><span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 5.</i></span> used by
    the <i>Romans</i>. Whereof, I shall have more occasion to speak, when I
    come to set down, for what use this <i>Antiquity</i> at first erected.</p>

  <p>Again, the <i>Portico</i> at <i>Stoneheng</i>, is made double, as in
    structures of great magnificence the ancient <i>Romans</i> used; so
    at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> the foot of the <i>Capitol</i> the <i>Temple</i> to <i>Jove the
    Thunderer</i>, built by <i>Augustus Cæsar</i>; so the <i>Pantheon</i>
    at <i>Athens</i>, royally adorned with one hundred and twenty vast
    columnes of rich <i>Phrygian</i> marble, by the <i>Emperour Adrian</i>.
    But, some may alledge, the <i>Romans</i> made the Pillars of their
    double <i>Portico’s</i>, of one and the same symmetry, or very little
    different, which in this <i>Antiquity</i> otherwise appearing, cannot
    be a <i>Roman</i> work. To as much purpose it may be alledged the
    <i>Temple</i> of <i>Diana</i> at <i>Magnesia</i>, was no <i>Greek</i>
    work, because the Pillars of the inner <i>Portico</i> were wholly
    left out. Yet it’s true, the <i>Romans</i> usually made them as is
    objected, and the reason was, because of the weight the inner Pillars
    carried: now, in this work, no roof being to be sustained, nor any
    manner of weight born up, though the judgement of the <i>Architect</i>,
    thereby to save labour and expence, ordered the stones making the
    <i>Portico</i> within, of a far lesse proportion then those of the
    outward circle, it retains neverthelesse the proper <i>Aspect</i>
    (principally aim’d at by the ancient <i>Architects</i>) in use amongst
    the <i>Romans</i>, and consequently for ought alledged to the contrary
    by them built.</p>

  <p>In this <i>Antiquity</i>, there is a <i>Portico</i> also (as I may
    rightly term it) within the <i>Cell</i>, or greater <i>Hexagon</i>,
    reduced likewise into the same figure. Now, that the <i>Romans</i>
    used to make <i>Portico’s</i> on the inside of their buildings, as
    well sacred as secular, by the ruines of their <i>Basilicaes</i> or
    Courts of <i>Judicature</i>; by that <i>Temple</i> without a roof
    anciently dedicated to <i>Jove</i> in Mount <i>Quirinalis</i>, now the
    <i>Horse</i> Mount in <i>Rome</i>; by the <i>Temple of Bacchus</i>
    there of a round form, at this day consecrate to S. <i>Agnes</i>
    without the gate <i>Viminalis</i>, manifestly appears. But in what
    ever structures else the <i>Romans</i> used them, certain it is,
    within their most stately <i>Temples</i> which lay uncovered, and had
    no roofs, they always made such <i>Portico’s</i>; and though in other
    <i>Temples</i> they sometimes dispos’d them, yet from <i>Vitruvius</i>
    it may be gathered, they properly belonged to the <i>Aspect
    Hypæthros</i>, which was uncovered and rooflesse as this <i>Antiquity
    Stoneheng</i>, he peremptorily assigning <i>Portico’s</i> to be made
    on the inside of no kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
    <i>Temples</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 1.</i></span> but those; His words are,
    <i>Hypæthros in interiore parte habet columnas, remotas à parietibus ad
    circuitionem (ut porticus) peristyliorum. Temples open to
    the air, and without roofs, have columnes on the inside, distant from
    the walls, as Courts Portico’s about them.</i> Even, after the same
    <i>decorum</i> as at <i>Stoneheng</i>.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, if cast an eye upon <i>their</i> artifice and manner of
    workmanship, <i>Stoneheng</i> appears built directly agreeable to
    those rules, which the <i>Romans</i> observed in great works. For,
    the <i>Roman Architects</i>, in distinguishing the manner of their
    <i>Temples</i>, always observed (as <i>Vitruvius</i> in his third book
    teacheth us) the greater the Columnes were, the closer they set them
    together; so in this <i>Antiquity</i>, the stones being great, the
    spaces betwixt them are likewise narrow.</p>

  <p>The <i>Architraves</i> also, in this work were all of them set without
    morter, and fixed upon the upright stones by tenons (as formerly
    described) in the very same manner, as in great structures, where the
    stones solid, and of more then ordinary greatnesse, the <i>Romans</i>
    were wont to doe.<span class="sni"><i>Leo Bap. Alber. lib. 3.</i></span> <i>They laid them without any unctuous incorporating
    matter, nullo fulta glutino</i>, saith <i>Leo Baptista Albertus</i>.
    And divers examples of this kind might be brought, I my self amongst
    other <i>Antiquities</i> have seen the ruines of an <i>Aquaeduct</i>,
    built by the <i>Romans</i> in <i>Provynce</i>, running through a
    deep valley, and raised in height equall to the adjacent Mountains,
    upon huge Arches fifty eight foot wide, the stones whereof, being of
    extraordinary scantlings, were laid without any cement or morter, to
    incorporate them with the rest of the work. And, where occasion guided
    their judgements to the observance of this rule, they united and
    compared the stones together, by certain ligatures or holdfasts, (the
    <i>Italians</i> call them <i>Perni</i>, pegs or tops, for such they
    resemble, and we, from the verb <i>tenere</i> to hold, not improperly
    calling them <i>tenons</i>) <i>quæ inferiores, &amp; unà superiores in
    lapides infixæ, cavatæ fuere, ne quid fortè protrusi ordines alteri
    ab alteris distrahantur. Which</i> (saith <i>Albertus</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Leo Bap. Alber. lib. 3.</i></span> <i>being
    formed in the inferiour stones, were hollowed or mortaised into those
    above, left by any chance they should start one from another, and break
    the order of the work</i>. Here the <i>Florentine Architect</i> gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
    us the self same manner of banding stones, when the <i>Romans</i>
    laid them without morter, as if he had seen this very <i>Antiquity
    Stoneheng</i>.</p>

  <p>Moreover, what ever footsteps of the <i>Romans</i> found in other
    places of this Island, it’s not inconsiderately to be past over,
    that in <i>Wiltshire</i>, the County (as is said before) where
    our <i>Stoneheng</i> remains, <i>Roman Antiquities</i> are most
    perspicuous, not only, by the apparent testimonies of the coyns of
    their Emperors in divers places digged up, but by severall their
    encamping places yet to be seen, as <i>Leckham</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Camden.</i></span> in times of yore a
    seat of the <i>Romans</i>: the place also where old <i>Salisbury</i>
    now sheweth it self, within six miles of <i>Stoneheng</i>: and within
    three miles thereof <i>Yanesbury</i> Castle, supposed a work of
    <i>Vespasians</i> when he conquered, and after kept in subjection the
    <i>Belgæ</i>, ancient inhabitants of that tract. Likewise the mines
    nearer yet to <i>Stoneheng</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Speed.</i></span> of a fortresse our Historians hold
    anciently a garrison of the <i>Romans</i>, and in many other forts of
    that Shire (both by their form and manner of making well known to have
    been <i>Roman</i>) the tract of their footing is yet left.</p>

  <p>But it is objected, If <i>Stoneheng</i> a <i>Roman</i> work, how
    comes it, no <i>Roman</i> Author makes mention of it? I answer, their
    Historians used not to commit to writing every particular work, or
    action the <i>Romans</i> performed: if so, how vast would their
    volumes have been? <i>Stoneheng</i> ’tis granted, is much admired
    by us, yet, how far more admirable works were the <i>Romans</i>
    Founders of, not mentioned in any of their ancient stories? That
    notable bridge invented and built by <i>Cæsar</i>, for passing his
    Army over the <i>Rhine</i>, himself at large describes, remembring
    little or nothing neverthelesse concerning divers other as great works
    in <i>Gaul</i> and <i>Batavia</i>, suppos’d to be performed by him
    also. <i>Dion</i>, <i>Herodian</i>, <i>Eutropius</i> and other their
    Historians tell us, the <i>Romans</i> built the so famed wall, commonly
    by us called the <i>Picts wall</i>, extending crosseover our Island
    from the <i>Irish</i> Sea to the <i>German</i> Ocean, above fourscore
    <i>Italian</i> miles in length, with many towers and fortresses erected
    upon it; when works of as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> great admiration in <i>Britain</i> they
    have past in silence: those wonderfull causeys made throughout the
    land, by dreining and drying up Fens, levelling hils, raising valleys,
    and paving them with stones of such breadth, that Wains might without
    danger passe one by another, not any ancient <i>Roman</i> Author (for
    ought appears) directly mentioning. Yet, who doubts them <i>Roman</i>
    works?<span class="sni"><i>Cam. fo. 64.</i></span> <i>I dare confidently avouch, the Romans by little and little
    founded and raised them up</i>, saith <i>Camden</i>. And why? mark
    I pray, because, whilst <i>Agricola</i> governed <i>Britain</i>,
    <i>Tacitus</i> tels us, <i>severall ways were enjoyned</i>. If then,
    because <i>Tacitus</i> affirms in generall terms only, <i>severall
    ways enjoyned</i>, <i>Camden</i> confidently concludes them <i>Roman
    works</i>, no <i>Roman</i> History otherwise remembring them; Why may
    it not, the same <i>Tacitus</i> telling us in like manner, <i>Agicola
    exhorted the Britans in private, and helpt them in common, to build
    Temples, Houses, and Places of publick resort</i>, as peremptorily
    be inferr’d, <i>Stoneheng</i> was a work built by the <i>Romans</i>,
    though not particularly remembred by them in their stories? In a word,
    <i>Temples</i> and places of publick resort,<span class="sni"><i>Tacitus.<br />Beda.</i></span> the <i>Romans</i> built
    here, and were the first that did so, leaving it to after ages to
    find out by their <i>Manner</i> of <i>building</i>, <i>Order</i> in
    <i>building</i>, and <i>Power</i> and <i>Means</i> for <i>building</i>,
    such lofty ruines, as appears in this <i>Antiquity</i>, could be
    remains of none but <i>Roman</i> building.</p>

  <p>The next thing to be enquired after, is, in what time <i>Stoneheng</i>
    built. Happily, about those times, when the <i>Romans</i> having
    setled the Country here under their own <i>Empire</i>, and, together
    with bringing over <i>Colonies</i> reduced the naturall inhabitants
    of this Island unto the society of civill life, by training them up
    in the liberall Sciences. For, <i>then also</i> (saith <i>Camden</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Camden fo. 63.</i></span>
    <i>did they furnish the</i> Britans, <i>with goodly houses, and stately
    buildings, in such sort, that the reliques and rubbish of their ruines,
    cause the beholders now, exceedingly to admire the same, and the common
    sort of People plainly say, those</i> Roman <i>works were made by
    Giants, of such exceeding great admiration, and sumptuous magnificence
    they are</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

  <p>This relation of <i>Camdens</i>, reflects chiefly upon the time of
    <i>Agricola</i>; neverthelesse, that <i>Stoneheng</i> (though fabled
    Giants work) was then built, I dare not affirm: the great works of
    the <i>Romans</i>, brought to perfection in this Island, being not
    the work of a day. It hath been the invention of wise <i>Romans</i>
    of old, affecting civility, to raise goodly buildings here: but the
    precise times when, in things so far from all knowledge, cannot be
    with any certainty avouched. For my part, I should choose to assign
    those times for building thereof, when the <i>Romans</i> in their
    chief prosperity most flourished here, and refer the first erection
    to the time betwixt <i>Agricolas</i> government formerly mentioned,
    and the reign of <i>Constantine</i> the Great: in order to which, the
    times rather somwhat after <i>Agricola</i>, if not during his own
    Lievtenancy, then next preceding <i>Constantine</i>. For, long before
    <i>Constantine</i> acquired the Soveraignty (which was not till the
    year of our Lord three hundred and ten) the magnificent splendor of
    that mighty <i>Empire</i> began sensibly to wane, and the ambition of
    the great Captains of <i>Rome</i>, (some few excepted) tended rather
    to make parties for obtaining the <i>Purple Robe</i>, then (after
    the manner of their ancestors) to eternise their names by great and
    admirable works, or patronizing good <i>Arts</i>, for want whereof they
    began likewise to decay apace; <i>Serly</i> in his third Book speaking
    of those times, telling us, that <i>id temporis Architecti, si cum
    superioribus conferantur, rudiores &amp; ineptiores extitisse videntur. In
    those days although there were many Architects, yet, compared with such
    as lived in the preceding Ages, they were very rude and unskilfull.</i>
    Besides, the condition wherein this Island was, divers years preceding
    <i>Constantine</i>, would not admit such undertakings. For, by the
    civil discord of the <i>Romans</i>, the <i>Britans</i> taking occasion
    to make frequent revolts, in hope to recover their lost liberty, the
    <i>Romans</i> were put upon other manner of Councels then to think
    of building; namely to reduce the <i>Britans</i> to their wonted
    obedience, and keep the Province in some reasonable quiet, by expelling
    the <i>Scots</i> and <i>Picts</i> (savage and perfidious <i>People</i>
    even from times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> of old)
    making daily inroads and incursions thereunto.</p>

  <p>Now, as for these reasons, it’s not likely <i>Stoneheng</i> could
    be built in the times next before <i>Constantine</i>, so, by what
    follows, it will manifestly appear, it was not erected after his Reign.
    For, after his transplanting the seat of the Empire into the East,
    and the government of the then known world, under the <i>Romans</i>,
    distinguished by <i>East</i> and <i>Western</i> Emperours, a deluge of
    barbarous Nations (like so many Locusts) swarmed over all. Who, as with
    their vast multitudes they oft had formerly attempted it, so, thence
    forward, till bringing that mighty Empire unto its finall and fatall
    period; and thereby utterly destroying in like manner all <i>Arts</i>
    and <i>Sciences</i>, together with <i>Architecture</i>, (not restored
    again, even in <i>Italy</i> it self, untill, as formerly remembred)
    they never desisted. Moreover, in the times after <i>Constantine</i>,
    no <i>Temples</i> to Heathen <i>Deities</i> (such as I shall make
    appear this <i>Antiquity Stoneheng</i> was) were erected here, they
    being times of defacing, rather then erecting idolatrous places.
    For, most of the succeeding Emperors becoming <i>Christians</i>, the
    tempestuous storms of perfection were over, and the thick clouds of
    superstition beginning to be dissolved by the bright beams of the
    Gospel, and true light of CHRIST, every where <i>Temples</i> were
    shut up against false Gods, and set open to the true GOD. According
    to that of <i>Gildas</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Gildas.</i></span> <i>No sooner was the blustering tempest,
    and storm of persecution blown over, but the faithfull Christians,
    who in the time of trouble and danger had hidden themselves in woods,
    deserts, and secret caves, being come abroad in open sight, renovant
    Ecclesias ad solum usque destructas, basilicas sanctorum martyrum
    fundant, construunt, perficiunt &amp;c. Churches ruinate to the very
    ground they reedifie, Temples of holy Martyrs they found, build, and
    finish &amp;c.</i> So that, in stead of idolatrous <i>Temples</i>, built
    in the Ages preceding <i>Constantine</i>, during his reign and after,
    whilst the <i>Romans</i> continued in any prosperous state here, by
    erecting <i>Christian Churches</i>, they began generally to neglect,
    and suffer fall to decay, rather then new build <i>Temples</i> to their
    <i>Pagan</i> Gods.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

  <p>These pressing occurrences therefore, to wit, civill broyls amongst the
    <i>Romans</i> themselves, frequent insurrections of the <i>Britans</i>,
    daily inrodes by the <i>Picts</i> and <i>Scots</i>, together with the
    <i>downfall</i> of <i>Paganism</i>, <i>decay</i> of <i>Arts</i>, and
    fatall <i>ruine</i> of the whole <i>Empire</i>, making the times both
    long before and after <i>Constantine</i> incompatible for undertaking
    such works as this <i>Antiquity</i>, it may safely enough be concluded,
    if <i>Stoneheng</i> not founded by <i>Agricola</i>, yet created it
    might be about fifteen hundred and fifty years ago, in the times
    somewhat after his government,<span class="sni"><i>Tacit. in Vit. Agr.</i></span> <i>the</i> Province <i>being formerly
    left by him in good and peaceable state</i>, the <i>Britans</i>
    reduced from <i>Barbarity</i> to order and civill conversation,
    and the <i>Romans</i> flourishing in all manner of <i>Arts</i> and
    <i>Sciences</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, concerning the use for which <i>Stoneheng</i> at first erected,
    I am clearly of opinion, it was originally a <i>Temple</i>, it
    being built with all accommodations properly belonging to a sacred
    structure. For, it had an intervall or spacious Court lying round
    about it, wherein the <i>Victimes</i> for oblation were slain, into
    which it was unlawfull for any profane person to enter: it was
    separated from the circumadjacent Plain, with a large Trench in stead
    of a wall, as a boundary about the <i>Temple</i>, most conformable
    to the main work, wholly exposed to open view: Without this Trench,
    the promiscuous common multitude, with zeal too much, attended the
    <i>ceremonies</i> of their solemne though superstitious Sacrifices,
    and might see the oblations, but not come within them: It had likewise
    its peculiar <i>Cell</i>, with <i>Portico’s</i> round about, into
    which <i>Cell</i>, as into their <i>Sanctum sanctorum</i> (pardon the
    expression) none but the <i>Priests</i> entred to offer Sacrifice,
    and make atonement for the <i>People</i>: Within the <i>Cell</i> an
    <i>Ara</i> or <i>Altar</i> was placed, having its proper position
    towards the <i>East</i>, as the <i>Romans</i> used. <i>Aræ spectent ad
    Orientem</i>, saith <i>Vitruvius</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 4. cap. 8.</i></span> And, that there hath been the
    heads of Bulls, or Oxen, of Harts, and other such beasts digged up, or
    in, or near this <i>Antiquity</i> (as divers now living can testifie)
    is not to be omitted; for who can imagine, but these were the heads of
    such, as anciently there offered in Sacrifice? toge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>ther with which
    also, were heaped up great quantities of Charcole, happily used about
    the performance of their superstitious ceremonies. That the ancient
    <i>Romans</i> had Charcole in use amongst them, <i>Pliny</i> affirms.<span class="sni"><i>Plin. lib.16.<br />Tom. 1. lib. 33.<br />Tom. 2.</i></span>
    And when I caused the foundations of the stones to be searched, my self
    found, and yet have by me to shew the cover of a <i>Thuribulum</i>, or
    some such like vase (I suppose) wherein <i>Choul</i> in his discourse
    of their Religion, reports<span class="sni"><i>Rosin. lib. 3.<br />Choul fol. 217, 229.</i></span> the ancient <i>Romans</i> used to carry
    Incense, wine or holy water, for service in their Sacrifices, lying
    about three foot within the ground, near one of the stones of the
    greater <i>Hexagon</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Order</i> whereof this <i>Temple</i> consists, according to the
    rules of <i>Art</i> observed by the ancient <i>Romans</i> in works of
    this kinde, is mingled of <i>Greek</i> and <i>Tuscane</i> work. For,
    as the plainnesse and solidnesse of the <i>Tuscane Order</i>, appears
    eminently throughout the whole <i>Antiquity</i>: so the narrownesse
    of the spaces betwixt the stones, visibly discovers therein, the
    delicacy of the <i>Corinthian Order</i>. Which commixture amongst the
    <i>Roman Architects</i> was very usuall, in regard <i>Vitruvius</i>
    (in his fourth Book and seventh Chapter) treating somwhat largely
    (his method otherwise considered) of severall sorts of the like
    composed <i>Temples</i>, mixt of the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Tuscane</i>
    manners tels us:<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 4. cap. 7.</i></span> that, <i>Nonnulli de Tuscanicis generibus sumentes
    columnarum dispositiones, transferunt in Corinthiorum &amp; Ionicorum
    operum ordinationes. Some taking the qualities of the columns of the
    Tuscane Order, transfer them into the symmetry of the Corinthian and
    Ionick works.</i> Whereby (to please themselves it seems in their
    own inventions) <i>efficiunt Tuscanicorum &amp; Græcorum operum communem
    ratiocinationem. They make of the Tuscane and Greek works one common
    composure.</i> As the same Author likewise remembers.</p>

  <p>The <i>Aspect</i> of this <i>Temple</i>; by which we understand that
    first shew which <i>Temples</i> make to those that draw near unto them,
    is <i>Dipteros Hypæthros</i>, which is double winged about uncovered.
    <i>Dipteros circa ædem duplices habet columnarum ordines</i> (saith
    <i>Vitruvius</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 1.</i></span> <i>Dipteros hath double orders of columnes about the
    Temple. Hypæthros sub divo est, sine tecto</i>, (as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> same Author)
    <i>Hypæthros is open to the air, without a roof</i>.</p>

  <p>The Manner of this <i>Temple</i> is <i>Pycnostylos</i>, or <i>narrow
    spaces</i>. <i>Pycnostylos</i> is that kinde of <i>Temples</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 2.</i></span>
    which hath the columnes set thick, and close together <i>crebris
    columnis</i>, as <i>Vitruvius</i> also hath it.</p>

  <p>But it may be objected, though it appears from very good Authorities,
    the Artifice, and workmanship of this <i>Antiquity</i>, together
    with the <i>Scheam</i> which formed it, were <i>Roman</i>: and the
    <i>Order</i> of which consisting, invented in <i>Italy</i>, and so
    consequently <i>Roman</i> in like manner: as also, by the severall
    peculiar accommodations, the probable reliques of <i>Heathenish</i>
    Sacrifices, and determinate rules of <i>Architecture</i>, it was
    anciently a <i>Temple</i>: Neverthelesse it appears not, the
    <i>Romans</i> ever used any whatever profane structure like this, much
    lesse any manner of <i>Temples</i> of this kinde of invention, <i>Where
    the Temple lies open without walls, surrounded only with pillars</i>.
    For, that the upright stones which make this work <i>Stoneheng</i>, are
    in stead of them, may well enough be granted.</p>

  <p>To this I answer, the learned in <i>Antiquities</i> very well know,
    those things which oblivion hath so long removed out of mind, are
    hardly to be discovered. Yet, as to the first part of the objection,
    that the <i>Romans</i> never used any whatever profane structure
    like this, <i>Varro de re rustica</i> (as I find him cited by
    <i>Philander</i>) tels us,<span class="sni"><i>Phil. in Vitr. lib. 4.</i></span> that they had in use amongst them a round
    building without any wals, having a double <i>Order</i> of columns
    round about, this he cals by the name of <i>Tholus, ædificium
    rotundum, columnatum duplici columnarum ordine. A round edifice</i>
    (saith he) <i>environed about with a double order of columns</i>.
    Which double <i>Order</i> of <i>Columns</i> <i>Pyrrho Ligorio</i>
    a famous <i>Neapolitane Architect</i>, and great discoverer of
    <i>Antiquities</i>, in his description thereof designes without a roof also.</p>

  <p>But to come to their sacred works, which in regard of this
    <i>Antiquity</i>, are (it’s true) of most concernment, I find the
    <i>Romans</i> used (as <i>Vitruvius</i> witnesseth)<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 4. cap. 7.</i></span> such manner of
    <i>Temples</i>. For (in his fourth Book, and seventh Chapter) he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
    delivers, there were amongst others two forms of round <i>Temples</i>,
    commonly in use amongst them, the one called <i>Monopteros</i>; the
    other <i>Peripteros</i>. This, had the <i>Cell</i> enclosed about
    with a continued wall, and at a proportionate distance from it, the
    columns placed which made a <i>Portico</i> round about it, clean
    different from <i>Stoneheng</i>: the other made open, and in stead
    of a wall encompassed with a row of pillars only, having no enclosed
    <i>Cell</i> within it at all, as much conducing to our purpose in
    hand. His words are these,<span class="sni"><i>Ædes sacræ Templa dicta fuerunt, quòd essent quasi ædes
    Deorum.<br />Rosin. lib. 2. cap. 2.</i></span> <i>Fiunt autem ædes rotundæ, è quibus aliæ
    sine cella columnatæ constituuntur. They make also</i> (saith he)
    <i>round Temples, of which some are built without a Cell, environed
    with Pillars only</i>. These were without any wals, (as his Commenter
    hath it) lying open to the Air. And truly (as I may presume to say)<span class="sni"><i>Dan. Barbar.</i></span>
    from this very manner the invention of <i>Stoneheng</i> was principally
    taken, in ordering whereof, the <i>Architect</i> disdaining usuall and
    common forms, of both the aforesaid forms composed one. For, taking
    the outward circle from the <i>Monopteros</i>, he made it open also
    as in that, but in stead of the continued wall circularly enclosing
    the <i>Cell</i> of the <i>Peripteros</i>, at <i>Stoneheng</i> he made
    only an <i>Hexagon</i> about the <i>Cell</i>, leaving the same open
    in like manner. And, as <i>Hermogenes</i> (whom I shall have occasion
    to remember again) to illustrate his work, leaving out the inner row
    of Pillars, made a single <i>Portico</i> about the <i>Temple</i> at
    <i>Magnesia</i>, whereby it came to be a new invention, for which he
    is famous to posterity: so the subtile <i>Architect</i>, whosoever he
    was, to ennoble this his work, adding the said <i>Hexagon</i> here,
    made a double <i>Portico</i> round about this <i>Temple</i>, and
    thereby a new invention likewise, no lesse famous to succeeding Ages.
    Our <i>Antiquity Stoneheng</i> had otherwise been of the self same
    <i>Aspect</i> without a <i>Cell</i>, as <i>Vitruvius</i> hath before
    delivered. That <i>Temple Monopteros</i>, was environed with a row of
    pillars; this <i>Temple Stoneheng</i>, in stead of them, supplied with
    a rank of pillasters (as they may well be called) continuing round
    about it. That, lay open to the air without any walls: so doth this
    at <i>Stoneheng</i>. That, had over the pillars an <i>Architrave</i>,
    <i>Freese</i>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> <i>Cornice</i>, the <i>Order</i> being delicate:
    this at <i>Stoneheng</i>, over the pillasters an <i>Architrave</i>
    only, as most conformable to the solidnesse of the <i>Order</i> and
    plainnesse of the work.</p>

  <p>Thus it fully appears, the ancient <i>Romans</i> used to erect
    <i>Temples, which lay open without walls, surrounded only with
    pillars</i>; in invention like this at <i>Stoneheng</i>. But, let
    us see whether the form <i>Monopteros</i>, had any roof over it.
    That the <i>Romans</i> had <i>Temples</i> uncovered, and without
    roofs, like <i>Stoneheng</i>, is in part already, and shall more
    manifestly be hereafter proved: and searching curiously into their
    <i>Antiquities</i>, it will be found the greatest, most splendid, and
    most magnificent work of all others, which the <i>Ancients</i> made for
    service of their <i>Deities</i>, were those kinde of <i>Temples</i>
    of the <i>Aspect Hypæthros</i>. Whether the <i>Monopteros</i> was one
    of that kind, appears not yet, and <i>Vitruvius</i> is very obscure
    therein; neverthelesse, that it was built without a roof, I shall
    illustrate by these reasons.</p>

  <p>First, <i>Vitruvius</i> tels us not it had a roof; for, in his precepts
    of all severall kinds of <i>Temples</i>, after he hath delivered
    the <i>Aspect</i>, <i>Form</i>, and <i>Manner</i> of them with much
    exactnesse, he omits not throughout his fourth Book to demonstrate
    aswell the contignation, as proportion of timbers of the roofs,
    belonging to all those <i>Temples</i>, which had any, and when vaulted
    he gives us likewise the form thereof, if the <i>Temples</i> so
    covered: but, in the description of the form <i>Monopteros</i>, there
    is no manner of timber work, nor form of vault, nor the least word
    mentioned of any roof at all, in what place soever throughout his whole
    work speaking thereof. In which respect, considering all <i>Temples</i>
    having roofs, those roofs are described by <i>Vitruvius</i>, and that
    he describes no roof belonging to this, it must necessarily follow, the
    <i>Temples</i> in form <i>Monopteros</i> had no roofs over them.</p>

  <p>Again, after giving the proportion of the <i>Architrave</i> over the
    columnes of the <i>Monopteros</i>, he saith, <i>Zophorus &amp; reliqua
    quæ insuper imponuntur, ita uti in tertio volumine de symmetriis
    scripsit. The Freese and other ornaments laid upon them, are as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
    his third Book of symmetries made mention of.</i> Now, in his third
    Book, he only treats of proportions, and not one word is so much as
    mentioned by him of any manner of roofs at all, only in the close of
    the said Book, he gives the proportion of frontispices belonging to
    quadrangular <i>Temples</i>: the same referment in like manner he makes
    for the ornaments of the <i>Peripteros</i>, and withall proceeds to a
    full description, in what manner the roof of its <i>Cell</i> was made,
    which questionlesse, he would likewise have done in the other form, if
    it had been covered. For, he saith, whatever is to be laid above the
    <i>Freese</i> of the <i>Monopteros</i>, is, as set down in his third
    Book: but, in his third Book, there is not One word mentioned of any
    roofs; the conclusion then follows the <i>Monopteros</i> was without a
    roof.</p>

  <p>Lastly, he positively tels us it was <i>sine Cella, without a Cell</i>:
    now the <i>Cell</i> (and which for distinction sake I have so called in
    describing this <i>Antiquity</i>, because it was applied to the same
    use, to perform their sacred rites in) was indeed properly, the inner,<span class="sni"><i>Bern. Baldo.</i></span>
    or chief part of the <i>Temple, quam nos corpus Templi vulgò dicimus,
    we commonly call it the body of the Church</i>, which enclosed with
    wals, was covered with a roof, as <i>Vitruvius</i> declares in the form
    <i>Peripteros, tecti ratio ita habeatur &amp;c. The manner of a roof</i>
    (saith he) <i>was thus &amp;c.</i> But, the <i>Monopteros</i> was without a
    <i>Cell</i>, and consequently without a roof also, as having no walls
    to bear it. For, in regard of the manner of the <i>Architecture</i>,
    the pillars standing in <i>Island</i> (as we say) the work could not
    securely bear a roof, if made of any great capacity: either therefore,
    they made <i>Temples</i> of this form very little (in which respect
    only, <i>Palladio</i> supposeth it might be vaulted) inconsistent
    with the <i>Roman</i> greatnesse, or else, like <i>Stoneheng</i> they
    were wholly uncovered and rooflesse. Howsoever, it is manifest, the
    <i>Aspect</i> was just the same. And if I should say, the ruines of one
    after the same form also, remains yet in <i>Oxfordshire</i>, which the
    common people usually call <i>Rolle-rich-stones</i>, take it but as my
    conjecture only, as likewise one or two built after the like manner in
    <i>Scotland</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> no man unlesse <i>Hector Boetius</i> knowing by what
    Kings.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the proportions appearing in this <i>Antiquity Stoneheng</i>,
    are much conformable to those, assigned by <i>Vitruvius</i> to the
    parts of the <i>Monopteros</i>: He tels us, <i>Tribunal habent &amp;
    ascensum ex suæ diametri tertia parte: they had the Tribunal</i>, (by
    which is understood that levell upon which the <i>Temple</i> placed)
    <i>and the ascent, consisting of one third part of the Diameter</i>.
    So at <i>Stoneheng</i>, the work it self is one <i>third part of the
    Diameter</i> of the circumvallation: And, acording to the proportion
    allowed by him to <i>the Ascent</i>, it seems those <i>Temples</i>
    were sited more stately then others, (by consequence great also) and
    certain it is, whosoever views this <i>Antiquity</i> attentively
    with judgement, upon the place where remaining (for the <i>Folio</i>
    being too little I could not expresse it in Design) and doth allow a
    proportionate depth to the Trench surrounding it; considering also,
    together therewith, the levell of the plain lying without, he will then
    finde it standing upon such a rising ground, that the <i>Ascent</i>
    unto it, was not much lesse magnificent, then what <i>Vitruvius</i>
    hath declared.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, besides the aforementioned round <i>Temples, Vitruvius</i>
    in the same Chapter tels us, that, <i>generibus aliis constituuntur
    ædes, ex iisdem symmetriis ordinatæ, &amp; alio genere dispositiones
    habentes. The</i> Romans <i>built them after other manner of
    inventions, following the same proportions, and having their disposures
    after another kinde</i>. Of which, if vouchsafed to posterity the
    descriptions, some of them might have been found, not only agreeable
    in <i>Aspect</i>, but happily of the very self same form also, as this
    <i>Temple Stoneheng</i> doth appear.</p>

  <p>Now considering this discourse may happen into the hands of those, who
    cannot by words so easily apprehend things of this <i>Art</i>, I have
    for their satisfaction brought into <i>Design</i>, the plants of both
    the aforesaid <i>Temples</i> mentioned by <i>Vitruvius</i>, whereby
    their conformity with <i>Stoneheng</i>, and the invention thereof taken
    from them, is more clearly manifested.</p>

    which our <i>Antiquity</i> was formed; whereby the intersection of the

  <p>But, before deliver my judgment, unto which of their
    <i>Deities</i> this <i>Temple Stoneheng</i> was anciently dedicated
    by the <i>Romans</i>, I shall give you some customs in force amongst
    the <i>Ancients</i>, relating the <i>Decorum</i> used by them, in
    building their particular <i>Temples</i>: whereby, those several
    opinions seemingly conclusive to whom <i>Stoneheng</i> sacred, may
    more evidently appear invalid, and my own more apparently probable.
    Those therefore that endevour the searching out <i>Antiquities</i>
    of <i>Architecture</i>, must amongst others, especially prescribe
    to themselves five things to be guided by. <i>viz.</i> <i>The
    Situation</i>, <i>Aspect</i>, <i>Manner</i>, <i>Form</i>, and
    <i>Order</i> of the work as in use amongst the <i>Ancients</i>. For,
    inventing the severall ornaments of <i>Architecture</i>, at first for
    honour and distinction onely of their <i>Deities</i>, they appropriated
    to each of them particular <i>situations</i>, precise <i>forms</i>,
    peculiar <i>Orders</i>, according to the severall qualities, in regard
    whereof adored by them.</p>

  <p>The <i>situation</i> of the <i>Temples</i> to <i>Venus</i>,
    <i>Mars</i>, <i>Vulcan</i>, they ordained to be chosen without their
    Cities, as those which moved mens minds to lasciviousnesse, wars, and
    devastations. Within their Cities they placed the <i>Temples</i> of
    the Patrons of <i>Chastity</i>, <i>Peace</i>, good <i>Arts</i>: and of
    such Gods also, to whom the Protection of their Cities committed. To
    <i>Pallas</i>, <i>Mercury</i>, and <i>Isis</i> the chief Presidents of
    Artificers, and Merchants, they built <i>Temples</i> near the Market
    places, or upon the Market places themselves. To <i>Apollo</i> and
    <i>Bacchus</i> near the <i>Theater</i>. To <i>Hercules</i> near the
    Cirque or <i>Amphitheater</i>. Unto <i>Æsculapius</i> and <i>Salus</i>,
    in places most of all others healthfull, and near to pure streams,
    and waters; because the infirm people, coming out of a pestilent and
    contagious <i>Aire</i>, to that which was good and healthfull, by
    drinking those waters might the sooner, and with lesse difficulty be
    recovered, whereby zeal to those supposed <i>Deities</i> encreased.</p>

  <p>The <i>Aspect Hypæthros</i>, mentioned before, of which
    <i>Stoneheng</i> appears built, was proper only to some of their
    Gods, as shall be remembred in due time: the other <i>five</i>
    (needlesse here to name) were indifferently disposed, sometime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> to
    one, and sometime to another <i>Deity</i>, as the magnificence of
    the <i>Temples</i> to be built required, and, as to be made with
    <i>Portico’s</i> or without.</p>

  <p>The <i>Manner</i>, which <i>Vitruvius</i> distinguishes into five
    kinds, according as the intercolumnes are of five severall proportions,
    was only so far forth peculiarly appropriated to their <i>Deities</i>,
    as it was agreeable to the proper <i>Order</i>, otherwise they followed
    the greatnesse of the Work.</p>

  <p>But, to each of them appropriating particular forms of <i>Temples</i>;
    to some of their Gods, they made them of a round form, to others
    quadrangular, to others of many angles: some of them having their
    <i>Temples</i> covered, with roofs over them; others again built
    uncovered, without any manner of roofs at all: As, our <i>Antiquity
    Stoneheng</i>.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the <i>Order</i> of which they built them, was so diligently
    observed, according to the peculiar qualities of their <i>Deities</i>,
    that seldom or never they varied: as in fit place I shall remember.
    These aforesaid rules also were so firmly observed by the
    <i>Ancients</i>, that even at first sight the <i>Roman Architects</i>
    of old were able to judge, to what <i>Deity</i>, this, or that
    <i>Temple</i> sacred: and the modern <i>Italian Architects</i>, by the
    ruines of them at this day, give such notable testimonies towards the
    discovery of them, as are very hardly to be contradicted. Whosoever
    desires more of this, may read <i>Vitruvius</i>, <i>Leo Baptista
    Albertus</i>, and other Authors writing of <i>Architecture</i>.
    That then we may arrive to a degree of certainty unto whom our
    <i>Stoneheng</i> anciently dedicated; some such <i>Deitie</i> of
    the <i>Romans</i> is to be found out, in whose honour they built
    <i>Temples</i>, not only in such <i>situations</i> as this at
    <i>Stoneheng</i>; but with whole nature or quality the <i>Form</i>
    and <i>Aspect</i> thereof may be agreeable also; and the <i>Order
    proper</i>. For, whosoever goes about to enforce other reasons,
    do as I conceive but beat the air, neither can they reduce this
    <i>Antiquity</i> to any probable Originall.</p>

  <p>To which of the <i>Roman</i> Deities <i>Stoneheng</i> consecrated,
    are, as I said before, severall opinions. Some presume it sacred
    to <i>Diana</i>, but upon what ground their conjecture is raised,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
    considering both the <i>Aspect</i> and <i>Manner</i> of this
    <i>Temple</i> utterly different from those the <i>Ancients</i> used
    to dedicate to Her, I cannot conceive;<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 1 &amp; 2.</i></span> for, the <i>Manner</i> of the
    <i>Temples</i> erected to <i>Diana</i>, was <i>Diastylos</i>, i.e.
    <i>columnis ampliùs patentibus</i>, made with large and void spaces:
    the <i>Aspect</i> of that at <i>Ephesus</i> was <i>Dipteros</i>; that
    at <i>Magnesia Pseudodipteros</i>: which <i>Manner Hermogenes</i>
    inventing to save expence and labour, though he left out the
    <i>Order</i> of pillars within, and thereby the <i>Portico</i> came to
    be more large, yet the <i>Aspect</i> continued still the same. And, as
    in the <i>Aspect</i> and <i>Manner</i>, so likewise in the <i>Order</i>
    and <i>Form</i> it’s different: that, at <i>Ephesus</i> aforesaid being
    of the <i>Ionick Order</i>, the <i>Order</i> peculiarly appropriated
    to <i>Diana</i>, and quadrangular: of the same <i>Form</i> also, was
    that at <i>Magnesia</i> aforesaid, and so likewise the <i>Romans</i>
    built them, as by the now Church of S. <i>John</i> Evangelist at
    the <i>Latian</i>, or <i>Latine</i> Port, anciently the Temple of
    <i>Diana</i>; and that in Mount <i>Aventine</i> also,<span class="sni"><i>Fab. Cal.</i></span> the chief of her
    <i>Temples</i> in <i>Rome</i>, fully appears. The <i>situation</i> of
    the Temples dedicated to her, was in groves, whence <i>Vitruvius</i>
    cals<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 4. cap. 7.</i></span> her grovy <i>Diana</i>.</p>

    <i>Architecture</i> therefore of the Temples to <i>Diana</i>, and this
    at <i>Stoneheng</i> being so far different, there is no probable reason
    <i>Stoneheng</i> should be suppos’d dedicated to her.</p>

  <p>Moreover, whether or no this opinion maybe consistent with any of
    those qualities, the Ancients endowed this Goddesse with, let us
    examine further the Nature of the Deity it self. Is <i>Stoneheng</i><span class="sni"><i>Nat. Com. lib. 3. cap. 18.</i></span>
    consecrated to <i>Diana</i> because she presided over ways? what
    publick roads then, or common high-ways are to be read of, which
    anciently led over the Downs near this <i>Antiquity</i>? The most
    ancient ways we meet with, and which the <i>Romans</i> first made
    in this <i>Island</i>, as <i>Camden</i><span class="sni"><i>Camden fo. 64.</i></span> sets them down, are four,
    <i>Watling-street</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> <i>Ikemild-street</i>, <i>Ermin-street</i>, and
    the <i>Fosse</i>. <i>Watling-street</i> led through <i>Verolamium</i>
    directly as it were by a streight line to the West side of
    <i>Leicestershire</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Camden fo. 517.</i></span> and from thence through the Northerly Counties
    into <i>Wales</i>. <i>Ikemild-street</i> began in the Countrey of
    the <i>Iceni</i>, tending Eastward. <i>Ermin-street</i> in the same
    quarter, running through <i>Cambridgeshire</i>, <i>Huntingdonshire</i>,
    and so on towards <i>Lincolnshire</i> led the right way into the
    Northern Countreys on that side: (this street-way, happly, may be
    that which among the inhabitants passeth now by the name of <i>High
    Dike</i>.) The <i>Fosse</i> passing through <i>Warwickshire</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Ibid. fo. 366.</i></span> came
    down to <i>Stow</i> on the <i>Would</i>, thence to <i>Cirncester</i>,
    from <i>Cirncester</i> continuing on towards <i>Bath</i> and beyond it
    to <i>Somerton</i> into the Western Provinces: the ridge whereof is yet
    to be seen in divers places of that tract. All of them lying so far
    from <i>Stoneheng</i> that none of them are remembred to come nearer
    then <i>Cirncester</i> to any part of the Plains whereon it stands,
    and therefore in this respect there can be no cause to imagine this
    <i>Antiquity</i> should be dedicated to her. Or, is <i>Stoneheng</i>
    sacred to <i>Diana</i>, because she was the Patronesse of Gates? for
    which reason the Ancients built her Temples, either near to them within
    their Cities, or not far from them in the pleasant suburbs. But what
    Cities, or places having any such Gates, were ever found anciently so
    near <i>Stoneheng</i>, as might cause the dedication of so great a work
    to her? surely none. Or, is <i>Stoneheng</i> hallowed to <i>Diana</i>
    because she had the tutelage of Mountains? if so, then where are those
    Mountains to be found near this <i>Antiquity</i> on <i>Salisbury</i>
    Plains? which Plains, North, South, East and Westward through the midst
    of <i>Wiltshire</i> are so open, that they terminate the Horizon. If
    any such Mountains there, why do all Historians call them Plains? But
    admit Mountains somtimes on <i>Salisbury</i> Plain, what then became of
    them? were they removed by Earthquakes, swallowed into the ground by an
    <i>Hiatus</i> of the earth, or levell’d by inundations? then let it be
    made apparent when such like accidents fell out. Or is <i>Stoneheng</i>
    dedicated to <i>Diana</i>, because she delighted to bath her self
    in fountains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> fresh springs? where are those fountains and
    fresh springs to be found? haply, in the utmost borders they may be
    had, none certainly in the body of the Plains, or any thing near
    <i>Stoneheng</i>: spring veins being not there to be found, unlesse by
    sinking wells or pits very deep, which the inhabitants are enforced
    to make in severall places for watering their sheep, and as glad they
    are there, as the Patriarchs of old in the deserts of <i>Canaan</i> to
    come by them. Or is <i>Stoneheng</i> sacred to <i>Diana</i>, because
    reputed Goddesse of hunting? then, who ever desirous of a Temple for
    her, may finde it in <i>Daphne</i>, the anciently famous suburbs of
    <i>Antiochia</i>, where was not onely a Temple dedicated to her,<span class="sni"><i>Strab. li. 16.</i></span> but
    an <i>Asylum</i> also, as <i>Strabo</i> witnesseth: such places only
    being held proper for her mysteries, where interven’d variety of
    pleasures, goodly shadowy groves, delicate walks, and pleasant springs
    of most cool and fresh waters. In the midst of these delights the
    Ancients sited her Temples, not in wilde Downs, or vast Plains, so wide
    and open that hardly see from one side of them to another, affording
    neither shelter for travellers against canicular heats, nor succour
    for cattell against the boisterous blasts of blustering <i>Boreas</i>.
    Lastly, is <i>Stoneheng</i> dedicated to <i>Diana</i>, because the
    supposed guardian of woods? then remains it to be made apparent by
    them, those Plains in ancient times bore another countenance then
    at present. That they were full of Forrests, woods and groves, with
    variety of lawns, replenished and stored with such sorts of game, and
    wilde beasts in chase whereof <i>Diana</i> and her companions are said
    to recreate themselves: from whence some are of opinion she was called
    <i>Diana</i>, as much to say<span class="sni"><i>Rosin. lib. 2. cap. 7.</i></span>
    <i>Deviana, quoniam venantes per devia &amp;
    silvas deviare solent, captantes feras. Because of huntsmens deviating,
    or wandring out of the way, through uncouth paths and woods in pursuit
    of their game.</i> That those Plains afforded as much pleasure and
    delights as the <i>Thessalian Tempe</i>, the <i>Syrian Daphne</i>, or
    what place else as famous where her <i>Temples</i> anciently stood:
    and, in what unknown age they were disafforrested and laid wast. Which,
    if ever so, certainly some signs thereof would re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>main, or at least
    be found there, as well as in other parts of the Island, in times
    past overgrown with woods. As in <i>Anglesey</i> formerly mentioned;
    in <i>Cheshire</i>, where, in digging their marlepits are often found
    huge trees, demonstrating to posterity the forrests there anciently
    growing; in the Isle of <i>Axholm</i> in <i>Lincolnshire</i>, where
    the inhabitants have hardly any fewell, but what such trees afford so
    digged out of the earth; in <i>Somersetshire</i>, where I my self have
    seen trunks of trees lying under ground, and expressing the places in
    times past overgrown with trees, very few or none being in those places
    now standing. Besides, some remembrance of the aforesaid forrests and
    woods History questionlesse would yeeld; now what occasion soever
    Historians take for mentioning this tract, not one word is delivered
    by them to that purpose, all unanimously consenting ’twas never other
    then at present an open and champion Countrey. A Theater on which
    <i>Bellona</i> often displayed her bloody ensigns, and acted severall
    tragedies in times of old: A field of <i>Mars</i>, where <i>Romans</i>,
    <i>Saxons</i> and after <i>Danes</i> for obtaining the dominion of
    this Island decided their ambitious controversies. Of which actions
    we have visible testimony unto this day, witnesse those burrows, and
    places where they cast the bodies of their slain, over all quarters
    of the plain dispersed, which in long time are so shrowded by nature
    with ever growing grasse, that their memory will remain by their
    sepulchres to all posterity; that which consumes all works of Art,
    making them still more fresh and flourishing: witnesse spoils of war
    there frequently digged up, as formerly remembred: severall encamping
    places of those severall Nations in all parts of the plain even yet
    appearing, no place in the whole Island, respecting the circuit, having
    more remains of them: Also that huge Trench, mentioned before by the
    name of <i>Wansdike</i>, running through the very bowels of them, such
    manner of trenches appearing no where in any part of <i>England</i>
    beside, saving where the like plains interveen; so at <i>Newmarket
    Heath</i> the like trench vulgarly called <i>Devils Dike</i>, as if
    <i>made by Devils not by men</i>, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> to be seen; though in ancient
    times it was the limits of the Kingdome of the East <i>Angles</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Camden fo. 490.</i></span>
    and it took end, as <i>Camden</i> very well observes, <i>where the
    passages by reason of woods grew cumbersome</i>: Which, if the like
    be granted for <i>Wansdike</i> (as is very probable, it ending also
    with the Plains) then without controversie there were no more woods in
    times of old on <i>Salisbury</i> Plains then at this day; it running
    overthwart them, as in a direct line from East to West. And who knows
    not, that other manner of fortifications then running trenches upon
    direct lines are to be cast up for defence of woody situations? But why
    urge more Authorities, when the Inhabitants of the Countrey tell us,
    the soil or ground being hot, dry, and chalky is altogether improper
    for the growth of trees. Thus then the situation of the place, so
    antipathizing in all respects with the nature and qualities anciently
    attributed to <i>Diana</i>, and the <i>Manner</i>, <i>Form</i>, and
    <i>Order</i> of this <i>Antiquity</i>, so contrary to the custome used
    by the <i>Ancients</i> in erecting her Temples, no reason wherefore
    this <i>Temple Stoneheng</i> should be conceiv’d as erected for
    celebration of the superstitious ceremonies anciently ascribed unto her
    <i>Worship</i>.</p>

  <p>Some, again, would have <i>Stoneheng</i> consecrated to <i>Pan</i>;
    because <i>Pan</i> a <i>Greek</i> word signifying the <i>Universe</i>,
    under him the whole frame of <i>Nature</i> was adored. And therefore,
    the <i>Ancients</i> made his statues with horns, saith <i>Servius</i>,
    expressing thereby the beams of the <i>Sun</i>, and horns of the
    <i>Moon</i>; those issuing from his forehead, and turning upwards
    towards <i>Heaven</i>, as <i>Boccace</i> will have it, signified the
    Celestiall bodies: feigning also, as the world moves with extraordinary
    swiftnesse, he excelled likewise in speed of running. By the purple,
    ruddy, and enflamed face, attributed to <i>Pan</i>, that pure fire,
    above all other <i>Elements</i> holding his place in the confines
    of the Celestiall Sphears was demonstrated: by his large long beard
    descending down upon his breast, the two superiour Elements <i>Aire</i>
    and <i>Fire</i> of a masculine nature, sending down their impressions
    upon the other two naturally feminine was shewed: by the spotted skin
    cove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>ring his breast and shoulders, the eighth sphear wholly embelished
    with glorious stars; inveloping in like manner all appertaining to the
    nature of sublunary creatures was represented: by the sheep-hook which
    he held in one hand, Natures dominion over all things (according to
    <i>Boccace</i>) was signified: and as <i>Servius</i> saith, because
    this staffe, or rod was crooked, the year revolving into it self, was
    thereby expressed: in the other hand holding a Pipe, consisting of
    seven reeds, whereby, the Celestiall harmony conceived by some to have
    seven sounds, and seven different tunes, according to the number of the
    <i>Planets</i>, and their <i>Sphears</i> which are seven, was so set
    forth.</p>

  <p>After this manner <i>Mythologists</i> discourse of <i>Pan</i>,
    with various opinions, according to the subtile niceties of their
    severall fancies: and in these respects as having relation to the
    <i>Heavens</i>, this <i>Antiquity Stoneheng</i> is imagined sacred to
    <i>Him</i>. ’Tis true, if <i>Mythologie</i>, and not demonstrative
    reasons were to be fixt upon in matters of <i>Architecture</i>,
    the former conceptions might be some ground to frame conjectures
    <i>Stoneheng</i> sacred to <i>Pan</i>. But, <i>Architecture</i>
    depending upon demonstration, not fancy, the fictions of
    <i>Mythologists</i> are no further to be embraced, then as not
    impertinently conducing to prove reall truths. Wherefore, the aforesaid
    ancient rules for building <i>Temples</i> considered, and comparing the
    <i>Order</i>, <i>Form</i>, <i>Aspect</i> and <i>Situation</i> of the
    <i>Temples</i> to <i>Pan</i>, with the like in this <i>Antiquity</i>,
    so much contrariety is found betwixt them, as may convince any
    reasonable judgement <i>Stoneheng</i> not dedicated to <i>Him</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pan pastorum, venatorum, &amp; universæ vitæ rusticanæ præsidem
    crediderunt Antiqui</i>, saith<span class="sni"><i>Nat. Com. lib. 5.</i></span> <i>Natalis Comes</i>. <i>Pan</i> was the
    reputed <i>God</i> amongst the <i>Ancients, of Shepherds, Huntsmen, and
    all those that led an agrestick life</i>. The same Author also calling
    him <i>Piscatorum Deum</i>, the <i>God of Fishermen</i> as well as
    <i>Shepherds</i>. <i>Arcadibus Deorum antiquissimus &amp; honoratissimus
    est Pan</i>, saith <i>Dionysius</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Dion. Hali. lib. 1.<br />Rosin. lib. 2.</i></span> <i>Pan is the most ancient, and
    most honoured Deity of the Arcadians.</i> And in <i>Arcadia</i> itself
    where he was principally adored, they built his <i>Temples</i> for the
    most part in Towns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> of the same <i>Form</i> and <i>Order</i> as to
    <i>Juno</i>: In the <i>Town of Heræa</i>, <i>habet Pan templum suum</i>
    (saith <i>Pausanias</i><span class="sni"><i>Pausan. fo. 496.</i></span> in his description of <i>Arcadia</i>) <i>quod
    olim</i> Junoni <i>dicatum fuit</i>, Pan <i>had his Temple which
    anciently was dedicated to</i> Juno. Now, the <i>Order appropriated</i>
    to <i>Juno</i> by the <i>Romans</i>, was the <i>Ionick</i>, as is
    manifest from <i>Vitruvius</i>, who tels us, <i>To Juno, Diana, and
    Bacchus</i>, and to the other <i>Deities</i><span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 1. cap. 2.</i></span> of the same quality,
    <i>they built Temples of the Ionick Order</i>. The <i>Form</i> in
    like manner of her sacred structures was quadrangular, as in Mount
    <i>Aventine</i>, in <i>foro Olitorio</i> (or the herb Market) in
    Mount <i>Quirinal</i>, and elswhere amongst the <i>Romans</i> the<span class="sni"><i>Alexan.<br />Don.<br />Pomp. Totti.</i></span>
    <i>ruines</i> of her <i>Temples</i> do evidently witnesse: as also,
    her <i>Temples</i> anciently at <i>Argos</i>, and amongst the
    <i>Elians</i> in <i>Greece</i>, built of the like <i>Form</i>, and
    of the <i>Dorick Order</i>. But this <i>Antiquity</i><span class="sni"><i>Pausan. fo. 114. &amp; 317.</i></span> is of the
    severe <i>Tuscane</i> work, and of a round figure. The <i>Temples</i>
    to <i>Pan</i> had a <i>Portico</i> onely in <i>front</i>, at
    <i>Stoneheng</i> it continues round about the <i>Cell</i>. The
    <i>Temples</i> to <i>Pan</i> were not exposed to the open <i>Aire</i>,
    and built uncovered as <i>Stoneheng</i> was, but had roofs upon
    them. For, <i>Ignis ei perpetuus ardebat</i>, therein <i>they kept
    perpetuall fire</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Ibid. fo. 516.</i></span> as at <i>Acacesium</i> a <i>Town</i> also of
    <i>Arcadians</i>; all <i>Temples</i> wherein they kept such fires
    being covered, as the <i>Temple</i> to <i>Apollo</i> at <i>Delphos</i>
    amongst the <i>Greeks</i>, and to <i>Vesta</i> at <i>Rome</i> amongst
    the <i>Romans</i>. But, if at any time they did erect them distant
    from a <i>Town</i>, reserving always the <i>Form</i> and <i>Order</i>,
    they chose such situations as wholly environed with trees; for
    example, the <i>Temple</i> to <i>Pan</i> in Mount <i>Lycæus</i>, was
    compassed in with a thick wood, <i>condenso circumseptum luco</i>, as
    <i>Pausanias</i> hath it: so likewise, that <i>Temple</i> sacred to
    <i>Him</i> in the <i>Parthenian</i> Forrest, according to the said
    Author. Now, this <i>Temple Stoneheng</i> is sited in an open champion
    Countrey, where scarce a bush or tree, much lesse thick woods, or
    forrests to be seen throughout the whole Plain; nor was there ever any
    in times of old as History remembers, and the nature of the soil, as
    I am informed, is no wise prosperous for their growing there, as is
    sufficiently before declared.</p>

  <p>But <i>Pan</i> (say they) being the God of <i>Shepherds</i>, why might
    not <i>Stoneheng</i> to gratifie them be erected, and consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
    by the <i>Romans</i> dedicated to their God <i>Pan</i>? no place in
    the whole Island more abounding with sheep, then the circumadjacent
    Plains; the almost innumerable flocks whereof, not only most
    plentifully satisfying the bordering inhabitants for food; but, from
    their delicate fleeces, a great part of the known universe are clad
    also. I answer, amongst the <i>Romans</i> (declared at large before
    to be <i>Founders</i> of <i>Stoneheng</i>) I do not finde any one
    <i>Temple</i>, <i>Holy House</i>, <i>Sanctuary</i>, <i>Grove</i>,
    <i>Altar</i>, or any such like sacred structure consecrated to
    <i>Pan</i> in their own Country; much lesse any <i>Temple</i> dedicated
    unto Him by them in <i>Britain</i>: and therefore, utterly improbable
    this <i>Temple Stoneheng</i> should be erected by the <i>Romans</i>
    unto <i>Pan</i>.</p>

  <p>There was a <i>Temple</i> indeed,<span class="sni"><i>Dion. Hal. lib. 1.<br />Rosin. lib. 2. cap. 20.</i></span> built to <i>Pan Lycæus</i> on
    Mount <i>Palatine</i>, by those <i>Arcadians</i> which accompanied
    <i>Evander</i> into <i>Italy</i>; in which, though the <i>Romans</i>
    in succeeding times performed the same rites, as the <i>Arcadians</i>
    anciently had instituted; yet, <i>He</i> passed with the <i>Romans</i>
    under the name of <i>Lupercus</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Justin. lib. 43.</i></span> and in honour of <i>Him</i>,
    as some Authors of opinion, certain festivals or games called
    <i>Lupercalia</i>, at <i>Rome</i> onely, not in Provinces conquered
    by them, were solemnized by the <i>Romans</i>; Noblemens sons running
    in those games,<span class="sni"><i>Plutarch. in Rom.<br />Rosin. lib. 3. cap. 2.</i></span> according to the primitive institution setting forth
    and beginning their course at Mount <i>Palatine</i>, and so round
    about the City to the same place again. I may not omit, neverthelesse,
    that severall Authors deliver the <i>Lupercalia</i> were instituted
    in thankfulnesse to <i>Lupa</i>, or the wolf that gave <i>Romulus</i>
    suck, and the course of those games beginning at Mount <i>Palatine</i>
    (not so much in remembrance it seems of <i>Pans</i> Temple there,
    as) from the <i>Lupercal</i> or <i>the very place they say where</i><span class="sni"><i>Plut. in Rom.</i></span>
    Romulus <i>was cast out</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Dionysius</i> of <i>Halicarnassus</i> tels us<span class="sni"><i>Dion. lib. 1.</i></span> the <i>Arcadians</i>
    built the aforesaid <i>Temple</i> to <i>Pan</i>, <i>idoneo invento
    loco &amp;c.</i> when they had found out a <i>convenient place</i> for
    it adjoyning to their habitations: the condition or nature of which
    place is not unworthy your observation; for by his description
    thereof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> we shall easily perceive what manner of situation was by the
    <i>Arcadian</i> Shepherds held proper for performing the ceremonies of
    their God <i>Pan</i>. His words are, <i>Erat tum, ut fertur, spelunca
    sub tumulo magna, denso querceto contecta, &amp; sub petris profundi
    fonticuli, solúmque rupibus contiguum nemorosum, &amp; frequentibus ac
    proceris opacum arboribus: ibi ara deo extructa, more patrio sacra
    fecerunt. Under the Hill</i> (to wit, Mount <i>Palatine</i>) <i>was
    anciently, as report goes</i> (saith he) <i>a great cave or den,
    covered over by a thick grove, deep wells or riverets running amongst
    the stones of the cave, and round about it a wood, by the many and
    tall trees growing therein very dark and obscure: there the Altar of
    the God was placed, and his Sacrifices after their Country manner
    performed</i>. Now is <i>Stoneheng</i> thus sited, or was there ever
    any such like place near this <i>Antiquity</i>? of all the places
    in <i>England</i> that I know, none comes nearer that cave, then
    <i>Ochy-hole</i> in <i>Somersetshire</i>: And if the Ancients held such
    dismall situations only proper for <i>Pans Temples</i>, then without
    peradventure <i>Stoneheng</i> was never erected in honour of him, they
    being no innovators in their superstitions.</p>

  <p>A further observation may be made to our purpose, upon the aforesaid
    description, <i>Erat tum antrum magnum, it was anciently</i> (saith
    <i>Dionysius</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Dion. lib. 1.</i></span> <i>a great cave</i>. But in his own time, which was
    under <i>Augustus</i>, the <i>Romans</i> had so choked up the place
    with building, that the manner how <i>Pans Temple</i> in old time
    stood, was hardly to be discovered: <i>nunc quidem ædificiis</i> (saith
    he) <i>fanum circumquaque sepientibus, difficilis conjectura est qualis
    olim loci natura fuerit. At this present, verily, the Temple being
    every way environed with buildings, it is hardly to be conjectured
    in what manner of place it anciently stood</i>. This was the cause
    which enforced him to deliver to posterity the former description
    meerly upon report. Certainly then, the <i>Romans</i> employing the
    place to profaner uses, <i>Pans</i> Deity was little esteemed by them;
    otherwise, they would never have polluted it, by setting up private
    houses upon the place consecrated to him. Now the <i>Romans</i>
    slighting him after this manner at home, little reason appears so
    magnificent a structure as <i>Stoneheng</i>, should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> erected by them
    for adoration of <i>Pan</i> in other Countreys.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Sacrifices in times of old offered to <i>Pan</i>
    were milk and honey, offered up in simple Shepherds crocks or earthen
    pitchers: <i>quare non ritè sacrificabant, qui tauros illi immolabant,
    aut qui in aureis poculis lac aut vinum offerebant &amp;c.<span class="sni"><i>Nat. Com. lib. 5.</i></span> Wherefore, they
    sacrificed not aright</i>, saith <i>Natalis Comes, who immolated Buls
    or Oxen unto him, or out of golden cups poured forth milk or wine upon
    his Altars</i>; for goblets of that metall were proper onely for the
    supernall and celestiall <i>Deities</i>, not to terrestriall, and such
    as had care of Heardsmen or Shepherd Swains. To which purpose also, the
    same Author out of <i>Apollonius Smyrnæus</i> remembers <i>Pan</i>,
    thus speaking of himself.</p>

    years since there digged up.</p>

  <p>As for that of the <i>Pantheon</i>, it is very well known the
    <i>Ancients</i> so called it, not in any relation to <i>Pan</i>,
    but because it was sacred to <i>Jove</i> the <i>Revenger</i>, and
    according to others to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> <i>Cibele</i>, and all Gods. For which
    reason, <i>Boniface</i> the fourth obtained licence from the
    Emperour <i>Phocas</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Platin. in Bon.</i></span> to consecrate it to the <i>Virgin Mary</i>,
    and all Saints. And who knows not the <i>Architecture</i> thereof
    wholly different from this of <i>Stoneheng</i>? The <i>Pantheon</i>
    hath its <i>Cell</i> enclosed with a continued solid wall, and
    the <i>Portico</i> only in front, of the delicate <i>Corinthian
    Order</i>; of which <i>Order</i> the inner part consisted likewise,
    being vaulted in most admirable and magnificent manner. From whence<span class="sni"><i>Dion. lib. 53.</i></span>
    <i>Dion Cassius</i> delivers his opinion, <i>inde id nominis habere,
    quod forma convexa fastigiatum, cœli similitudinem ostenderet, it
    to be called the</i> Pantheon, <i>because by the form of that vault
    wherewith covered, it represented the concave of Heaven</i>, or (as
    others will) the figure of the world; for the world being mans house,
    the firmament is as the vaulted roof thereof. At the crown of the vault
    it had an opening, by which only it received light and air. But, this
    <i>Antiquity Stoneheng</i> built of a grave and humble <i>Order</i>
    (as is said before) had a double <i>Portico</i> continuing round about
    it, the Cell thereof free and open, and every way exposed to the air,
    received light from all parts.</p>

  <p>Wherefore leaving these, <i>Stoneheng</i> was dedicated, as I conceive,
    to the God <i>Cœlus</i>, by some Authors called <i>Cœlum</i>, by others
    <i>Uranus</i>, from whom the Ancients imagined all things took their
    beginning. My reasons are, First, in respect of the <i>situation</i>
    thereof; for it stands in a Plain, remote from any <i>Town</i> or
    <i>Village</i>, in a free and open air, without any groves or woods
    about it.</p>

  <p>Secondly, in regard of the <i>Aspect</i>; for <i>Stoneheng</i>
    was never covered, but built without a roof. Which <i>Decorum</i>
    the <i>Romans</i> ever observed, both in the <i>Situation</i> and
    <i>Aspect</i> of the <i>Temples</i> dedicated to this their God, and to
    <i>Jove</i> the <i>Lightner</i>, the <i>Sun</i>, and the <i>Moon</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. li. 1. cap. 2.</i></span>
    <i>Jovi fulguratori, &amp; Cœlo, &amp; Soli, &amp; Lunæ, ædificia sub divo
    Hypæthráque constituuntur. To</i> Jove <i>the Lightner, and to Cœlus,
    and to the Sun, and to the Moon, they erected buildings in the open
    air and uncovered</i>, saith <i>Vitruvius</i> in the second Chapter of
    his first Book. Take with you also his reason. <i>Horum enim Deorum
    &amp; species &amp; effectus in aperto mundo atque lucenti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> præsentes
    videmus, because both the forms and effects of these Deities, we behold
    present before our eyes, in a clear and open view.</i> Another reason
    I find also why they built their Temples to <i>Cœlus</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Godw. Antiq. l. 1. cap. 20.</i></span> and those
    other Deities uncovered as <i>Stoneheng</i>: because they counted it
    an hainous matter to see those Gods confined under a roof, whose doing
    good consisted in being abroad.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, in regard of the <i>Form</i> of <i>Stoneheng</i>, which is
    <i>circular</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Pier. Valer.<br /> Hier. lib. 39.</i></span> This figure was proper to the <i>Temples</i> of
    <i>Cœlus</i> and <i>Tellus</i>, whom the Ancients called <i>Vesta</i>,
    as <i>Valerianus</i> (in his <i>Hieroglyphicks</i>) affirms. <i>Non
    solamente la palla, ma una simplice piegatura di ruota, appresso
    gli Egizziani demostrava il Cielo. Not only</i> (saith he) <i>the
    circular form, but the meer segment of a circle amongst the Egyptians
    was an Hieroglyphick of Cœlus</i>. And to this purpose also, <i>Leo
    Baptista Albertus</i> useth these words.<span class="sni"><i>Leo Bapt.<br />Alb. lib. 7.</i></span> <i>Ædem Vestæ, quam esse
    terram putarent, rotundam ad pilæ similitudinem, faciebant. Unto Vesta,
    whom they reputed to be the Earth, they built Temples of a round form
    globelike</i>. Besides, observe what <i>Philander</i> commenting on
    <i>Vitruvius</i> tels us.<span class="sni"><i>Philand. in 4. lib. Vitr. cap. 7.</i></span> <i>Templorum quanquam alia fiant quadrata,
    alia multorum angulorum, Cœli naturam imitati veteres, imprimis
    rotundis sunt delectati: Although</i> (saith he) <i>the Ancients made
    some Temples square, some of six sides, others of many angles, they
    were especially delighted with making of them round, as representing
    thereby the Form or Figure of</i> Cœlum, <i>Heaven</i>.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, in respect of the <i>Order</i> whereof <i>Stoneheng</i>
    built. The severity of this <i>Tuscane</i> work, retaining in it a
    shew (as it were) of that first face of <i>Antiquity</i> (as <i>A.
    Palladio</i> terms it)<span class="sni"><i>An. Pal. li. 1.</i></span> being most agreeable to the nature of this
    their God, reputed the ancientest of all their <i>Deities</i>, and
    Father of <i>Saturn</i>. For, it was the custome of the Ancients (as
    in part I remembred before) to appropriate the severall <i>Orders</i>
    of <i>Architecture</i>, according to the particular qualifications
    of those they deified.<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 1. cap. 2.</i></span> <i>Minervæ, &amp; Marti, &amp; Herculi, ædes Doricæ
    fient: his enim diis propter virtutem, sine deliciis ædificia constitui
    decet. To Minerva, and Mars, and Hercules, Temples of the Dorick
    Order were made; for, to these Deities in respect of their valiant
    actions, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> was requisite to build without delicacy. Veneri, Floræ,
    Proserpinæ, Fontium Nymphis, Corinthio genere constitutæ, aptas
    videbuntur habere proprietates, quòd his diis propter teneritatem,
    graciliora &amp; florida, foliísque &amp; volutis ornata opera facta augere
    videbuntur justum decorem. To Venus, Flora, Proserpina, the Fountain
    Nymphs, the Corinthian Order was thought most proper: because unto
    these in regard of their tender natures, the work seemed to advance
    a just decorum, when made delicate and flourishing, and adorned with
    leaves and volutes. Junoni, Dianæ, Libero Patri cæterísque diis qui
    eadem sunt similitudine, si ædes Ionicæ construerentur, habita erat
    ratio mediocritatis, quod &amp; ab severo more Doricorum, &amp; à teneritate
    Corinthiorum, temperabitur earum institutio proprietatis. To Juno,
    Diana, Bacchus, and to the other Deities of the same quality, building
    Temples of the Ionick Order, they had regard unto the mean, that from
    the severe manner of the Dorick, and delicacy of the Corinthian, the
    condition of their indowments might be duly moderated</i>, saith
    <i>Vitruvius</i>. To <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Sol</i>, and <i>Luna</i>,
    though they made Temples <i>sub divo</i> open to the air and without
    roofs like this <i>Antiquity</i>; yet were they not built of severe
    and humble but most delicate <i>Orders</i>, and accordingly were
    adorned with costly ornaments, and beautified with various enrichments
    in severall sorts of sculpture, as by the ruines of them in divers
    parts of <i>Italy</i> remaining to this day, evidently appears.
    Respecting therefore, this <i>Decorum</i> used by the <i>Ancients</i>
    in building their <i>Temples</i>, and that this work <i>Stoneheng</i>
    is principally composed of a most grave <i>Tuscane</i> manner, by just
    proportions of an agreeable form; it is in mine opinion, as I said
    before, most agreeable to the quality and condition of that ancient
    <i>Cœlus</i>, whom Antiquity reputed the very stem whence all those
    Deities in the succeeding Ages proceeded. Cœlus <i>ex eadem conjuge
    (scilicet Tellure) procreavit</i> Oceanum, Cœlum, Hyperionem <i>&amp;c. &amp;
    <span class="sni"><i>Apollod. lib. 1.</i></span>
    novissimum omnium</i> Saturnum <i>suscepit</i>. Cœlus, <i>by the same
    wife</i> (to wit <i>Tellus</i>) <i>had</i> Oceanus, Cœlum, Hyperion
    <i>&amp;c. and last of all begat</i> Saturn. To which purpose also
    <i>Lactantius, I finde</i> Uranius <i>by his wife</i> Vesta <i>had</i>
    Saturn <i>and</i> Ops: Saturn <i>attaining the government, called his
    father</i> Uranius, Cœlus, <i>and his mother</i> Terra; <i>that by
    this change of names,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> he might the more magnifie the splendor of his
    originall &amp;c.</i> Further, I conceive it will not be impertinent to our
    purpose in hand, to deliver what the <i>Ancients</i> have reported of
    <i>Cœlus</i>; and wherefore they ascribed divine Honours unto Him.</p>

  <p>According to the <i>Poets</i>, <i>Cœlus</i> was not that huge machine
    adorned with stars, which <i>Orpheus</i> saith was composed for
    habitation of the <i>Planets</i>, and other <i>Deities</i>, and which
    we behold moving with continuall revolution: but a certain man so
    called, son to <i>Æther</i> and <i>Dies</i>, that, is <i>della virtù
    ardente, &amp; della luce famosa, of transcendent influence and resplendent
    brightness</i>, as <i>Boccace</i> hath it.<span class="sni"><i>Boccace lib. 3.</i></span></p>

  <p>By Historians, especially <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Diodor. lib. 4.</i></span> it’s thus delivered.
    <i>Scribunt primùm regnasse apud Atlantides</i> Cœlum: <i>Hominésque
    antea per agros dispersos, ad cœtum, condendásque urbes exhortatum, à
    fera eos agrestíque vita ad mitiorem cultum extitisse &amp;c. They write,
    he which first reigned over the</i> Atlantides <i>was</i> Cœlus, <i>and
    that he invited men living dispersedly before throughout the fields,
    to convene, and dwell in companies together, exhorting them to build
    Towns, and reducing them from wild and savage to the conversation of
    civill life: Taught them also to sow corn and seeds, and divers other
    things belonging to the common use of mankind; Ruled likewise over a
    great part of the world from East to West; Was a diligent observer of
    the stars, and foretold men divers things to come: The year (before
    confus’d) bringing into Order, according to the course of the Sun,
    reducing it also into moneths after the Moons course, and appointing
    likewise the severall seasons of the year. Whereby many ignorant of the
    perpetuall course of the stars, and amazed at his future predictions,
    did verily believe he participated of Divine Nature, and therefore
    after his death, as well for benefits received from him, as great
    knowledge of the stars, they conferred on him immortall honours, and
    adored him as a God. And, as appears, called</i> Cœlus <i>in regard of
    his skill in the celestiall bodies, as also, for divers other causes
    eternall King of all the world</i>. Thus <i>Diodorus</i>. It being an
    ordinary custome among the Heathens to deifie, and esteem for Gods,
    such excellent personages, as either had well ruled, or governed them,
    or done any notable thing among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> them to their especiall benefit, or
    good liking. Such, were they men, or women, remained with the name,
    reputation, and reverence of <i>Gods</i> or <i>Goddesses</i> after
    their deaths.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, according to the <i>Philosophers</i>; <i>Men</i> (they
    knew not how) by nature soon wanting, and by instinct as soon seeking
    some God (in stead of apprehending better) deified the <i>best</i>
    to sense. Whereupon, out of all <i>Entities</i> as most glorious to
    the eye, they first made choice of <i>Heaven</i>, and <i>Heavenly</i>
    bodies; considering again, as the most beneficiall objects,<span class="sni"><i>Plut. Phil. opin. lib. 1.</i></span> those
    living creatures, and fruits which the <i>Earth</i> beneath brought
    forth, to make compleat generations, they coupled <i>Cœlus</i> to
    <i>Tellus</i>, adoring <i>Heaven</i> as Father, and <i>Earth</i>
    as Mother to these; the pouring down of showers from <i>Heaven</i>
    seeming in stead of naturall seeds, and the <i>Earth</i> as a Mother to
    conceive, and bring forth the same.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, the Sacrifices in times of old offered to <i>Cœlus</i>
    were Bulls or Oxen, their great God <i>Jupiter</i> himself, as I
    find in <i>Rosinus</i>, offering such Victimes unto him.<span class="sni"><i>Rosin. lib. 2. cap. 5.</i></span> <i>Ante
    pugnam, que cum Gigantibus in</i> Creta <i>habita est</i>, Jovem
    <i>sacrificasse dicunt</i> Soli, Cœlo, <i>ac</i> Terræ <i>bovem.
    Before the battell struck with the Giants in</i> Crete, <i>they
    say</i> Jupiter <i>sacrificed an Oxe to</i> Sol, Cœlus, <i>and</i>
    Terra. Now that there hath oftentimes been digged out of the ground
    at <i>Stoneheng</i>, the heads of such beasts, in all probability
    anciently in that place sacrificed; I need not again remember, being it
    is so well known.</p>

  <p>Sixthly, all the upright stones in this <i>Antiquity</i> are
    <i>Pyramidall</i> like flames, in imitation of those <i>Ætheriall</i>
    fires, wherewith the <i>Heaven</i> is adorned.<span class="sni"><i>Pier. Valer. Hier. lib. 60.</i></span> Now, that <i>Fire</i>
    hath the form of a <i>Pyramis</i> is evident, <i>percioche, essendo
    largo da basso, intorno alla materia &amp; esca, da che si pasce, finisce
    in acuta fiammache riguardo al Cielo. Because, being large at the
    bottome, in respect of the matter and fewell, by which it is fed, it
    finishes in an acute flame tending upwards towards Heaven.</i> And,
    that the Heavens are adorned with fires, <i>Natalis Comes</i> in his
    Mythology, out of <i>Orpheus</i>, makes apparent. <i>Nihil aliud esse
    Cœlum existimans, nisi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> hunc æthera qui constat ex altissimis illis
    ignibus. Supposing the Heaven to be no other thing, but this Air which
    consisteth of those transcendent Fires.</i></p>

  <p>Lastly, that <i>Stoneheng</i> was anciently dedicated to <i>Cœlus</i>
    I collect from the <i>Conformation</i> of the work. For the
    <i>conformation</i> of the <i>Cell</i> and <i>Porticus</i> in
    the Plant, was designed with four equilaterall <i>Triangles</i>,
    inscribed in a <i>Circle</i>, such as the <i>Astrologers</i> use in
    describing the twelve <i>celestiall</i> signs in musicall proportions.
    According to that of <i>Vitruvius</i>;<span class="sni"><i>Vitr. lib. 5.</i></span> <i>In ea conformatione quatuor
    scribantur trigona paribus lateribus &amp; intervallis, quæ extremam lineam
    circinationis tangant; In the conformation thereof let four triangles
    be inscribed of equall sides and intervals, which may touch the extreme
    part of the circumference: quibus etiam in duodecim signorum cœlestium
    descriptione, Astrologi ex musica convenientia astrorum ratiocinantur;
    by which figures also, Astrologers from the musicall harmony of the
    stars ground their reasonings, as concerning the description of the
    twelve celestiall signs</i>. Besides the <i>Cell</i> it self in the
    formation thereof, is cast into an <i>Exagon</i>, one of the three
    figures, likewise used by <i>Astrologers</i> in their aforesaid
    arguments of the <i>sympathy</i> of the stars. <i>Figuris tribus</i>
    (saith <i>Philander</i>) <i>utuntur Astrologi, Trigono, Tetragono
    &amp; Hexagono. The Astrologers make use of three sorts of figures;
    the Triangle, Tetragon, and Hexagon.</i> Furthermore, the three
    entrances leading into the Temple from the Plain, were comparted by an
    equilaterall <i>triangle</i>; which was the figure whereby the Ancients
    expressed what appertained to <i>Heaven</i>, and divine mysteries
    also.<span class="sni"><i>Pier. Valer.<br />Hier. lib. 39.</i></span> <i>Aggiungono i Magi</i> (saith <i>Pierius Valerianus</i>)
    <i>che un triangolo semplice di lati uguali, è indizio di divinità,
    overo effigie di cose celesti. The</i> Magi <i>adde that a triangle
    of equall sides is a symbole of Divinity, or sign of celestiall
    matters</i>. Now this <i>Antiquity</i> consisting of severall stones,
    orderly disposed into one entire work, in imitation, as it were, of
    those severall stars which appearing to us in the Heavens in form of
    a circle, are called the <i>celestiall Crown</i>; and wholly designed
    by those <i>Scheams</i> wherewith <i>Astrologers</i> use to describe
    <i>celestiall</i> bodies, which figures, usually applied by them to
    particular accidents onely, being all joyntly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> made use of by the
    <i>Architect</i> for conformation of this sacred structure, it is not
    improbable <i>Stoneheng</i> was so composed, because dedicated to
    <i>Cœlum</i>. Yea further, (if lawfull to compare an idolatrous place
    with so divine a work) was not the <i>Temple</i> at <i>Hierusalem</i>
    adorned with the figures of <i>Cherubims</i>; that thereby the
    Nations of the Earth might know it was the habitation of the living
    God? and, why not in like manner this <i>Temple</i> composed by
    <i>Astrologicall</i> figures, that after Ages might apprehend, it was
    anciently consecrated to <i>Cœlus</i> or <i>Cœlum</i> Heaven?</p>

  <p>But in this conjuncture; concerning such kinde of <i>Temples</i> as
    this at <i>Stoneheng</i>, what saith the learned <i>Patriarch</i>
    of <i>Aquileia</i>?<span class="sni"><i>Dan. Barba. in lib. 4.<br />Vitr. cap. 7. in Ven. 1584.</i></span> <i>Io credo, che quel Tempio senza parete
    significava alcune cose del Cielo, gli effetti delle quali sono
    nelle scoperto. I beleeve that Temple without walls</i> (speaking
    of the <i>Monopteros</i> aforesaid) <i>had a relation to</i> Cœlum
    (<i>Heaven</i>) <i>because the effects thereof are openly displaied to
    the full view of all men</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Camden</i> tels us he had heard, that in the time of King
    <i>Henry</i> the eighth, a table of metall was found, not far from this
    <i>Antiquity</i>, engraven with divers strange characters, which being
    not legible, was neglected and lost: had, indeed, that Table been found
    within the work it self it might happily have brought to light somwhat
    in relation to <i>Stoneheng</i>. And by all likelihood, in time some
    inscriptions may therein be found, it being the custome as well of
    <i>Greeks</i> as <i>Romans</i>, in times of greatest <i>Antiquity</i>,
    to lay inscriptions (usually) under the first stones set in what works
    soever; especially, those of any great magnificence. Wherefore, I
    advise mine honoured Friend <i>Laurence Washington</i> Esquire in whose
    demeasnes this <i>Antiquity</i> stands, to whom I am much obliged, for
    his friendly notice of what things have been there of late years digged
    up, that he would be solicitous upon any search made there, to enquire
    after them, and if any found not to neglect, or curiously conceal them,
    but preserve and willingly produce the same.</p>

  <p>I suppose, I have now proved from Authentick Authors, and the rules
    of Art, <i>Stoneheng</i> anciently a <i>Temple</i>, dedicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> to
    <i>Cœlus</i>, built by the <i>Romans</i>; either in, or not long
    after those times (by all likelihood) when the <i>Roman</i> Eagles
    spreading their commanding wings over this <i>Island</i>, the more
    to civilize the Natives, introduc’d the <i>Art</i> of Building
    amongst them, discovering their ambitious desire, by stupendious
    and prodigious works, to eternize the memory of their high minds to
    succeeding Ages. For, the magnificence of that stately <i>Empire</i>,
    is at this day clearly visible in nothing more, then in the ruines
    of their <i>Temples</i>, <i>Palaces</i>, <i>Arch’s Triumphals</i>,
    <i>Aquæducts</i>, <i>Thermæ</i>, <i>Theaters</i>, <i>Amphitheaters</i>,
    <i>Cirques</i>, and other secular, and sacred structures.</p>

  <p>History affords only <i>Contemplation</i>, whereby their great Actions
    are made conceivable alone to reasoning: but the ruines of their
    buildings <i>Demonstration</i>, which obvious to sense, are even yet as
    so many eye-witnesses of their admir’d atchievements.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Opinions fancied to the contrary, I have rendred
    improbable, the Authors of them in respect of this <i>Antiquity</i>
    being not only modern; but also, what said by them <i>Romance</i>-like
    hatched out of their own brains,<span class="sni"><i>Camd. fo. 8.</i></span> even as other fables invented by
    them, touching the <i>Britains</i> of old. Men possest neverthelesse,
    with a former conceit of things, endure not by any means new opinions,
    having not commonly patience to search long after the truth thereof.
    To them, ever the more generally received, the truer things seem,
    accounting all of their own time despicable; insomuch, as some are so
    far in love with vulgarly receiv’d reports, that it must be taken for
    truth, whatsoever related by them, though nor head, nor tail, nor foot,
    nor footstep in it oftentimes of reason or common sense. They that
    beleeve <i>Geffrey Monmouths ipse dixit</i>, may make themselves merry
    therewith; in pleasing their own fancy, they displease not mine. As I
    have delivered my own judgement freely, all reason they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> should enjoy
    theirs. But such as sail in the vast Ocean of time, amongst the craggy
    rocks of <i>Antiquity</i>, steering their course, betwixt anciently
    approved customs, and convincing arguments, guided by good Authority,
    and sound judgement, arrive much safer, and with better repute, in
    the secure Haven of undoubted <i>Truth</i>. For mine own part, I had
    rather erre happily with venerable <i>Antiquity</i>, then so much as
    trouble my thoughts with modern conceits. Whether, in this adventure,
    I have wasted my Barque into the wished <i>Port</i> of <i>Truths</i>
    discovery concerning <i>Stoneheng</i>, I leave to the judgement of
    skilfull <i>Pilots</i>. I have endevoured, at least, to give life to
    the attempt, trending perhaps, to such a degree, as either may invite
    others to undertake the Voyage anew, or prosecute the same in more
    ample manner, in which, I wish them their desired successe, and that
    with prosperous gales they may make a more full and certain discovery.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&trade;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away&mdash;you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&trade; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&trade;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&trade; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; License.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&trade; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>

        You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&trade;
        works.
    </li>

    <li style='display: list-item;'>
        You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&trade; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
